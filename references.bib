The study was conducted in the Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain aquifer system, in the eastern USA.
Study focus
Groundwater pH and redox conditions are fundamental chemical characteristics controlling the distribution of many contaminants of concern for drinking water or the ecological health of receiving waters. In this study, pH and redox conditions were modeled and mapped in a complex, layered aquifer system. Machine-learning methods (boosted regression trees) were applied to data from 3000 to 5000 wells. Predicted pH and the probability of anoxic conditions, defined by three thresholds of dissolved oxygen (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L), were mapped at the 1-km2 scale for each of 10 regional aquifer layers.
New Hydrological Insights for the Region
Maps depict the extent of acidic groundwater and oxic conditions in the shallow, unconfined surficial aquifer and in unconfined, recharge-proximal areas of underlying aquifers, in contrast to alkaline and anoxic groundwater elsewhere. Geographic patterns and influential predictors–including elevation, overlying confining-units thickness, and simulated groundwater age and flux–are consistent with prior understanding of the processes controlling pH and redox in the aquifer system. The model-based maps support robust estimates of aquifer proportions, either areal or volumetric, likely to contain groundwater of a specified quality or be vulnerable to specific pH- or redox-sensitive contaminants. The machine-learning methods were an effective tool to map groundwater quality at the regional scale.},

	abstract = {The long-term stability of atmospheric pCO2 is dominantly determined by the balance between the rate of CO2 input from magmatic/metamorphic degassing and the efficiency of CO2 uptake by silicate weathering via eventual precipitation as marine carbonate and by organic carbon burial. Silicate weathering is thought to represent a negative feedback to changes in atmospheric pCO2. The Late Cretaceous-Early Cenozoic was characterized by elevated atmospheric pCO2 and greenhouse climate, widely thought to be due to increased magmatic flux from mid-ocean ridges, flood basalts and continental arcs. Of interest here is the role of continental arcs in modulating long term atmospheric CO2 contents and climate. Continental arc magmatism is accompanied by rapid uplift and erosion due to magmatic/tectonic thickening of the crust, thus, the development of continental arcs might also enhance the global efficiency of silicate weathering, in turn increasing the efficiency of carbon sequestration. To assess the contribution of continental arcs to global carbon sinks, we conducted a case study in the Cretaceous Peninsular Ranges batholith (PRB) and associated forearc basin in southern California, USA, representing one segment of a Mesozoic circum-Pacific continental arc system. Arc magmatism occurred between 170-85 Ma, peaking at 100 Ma. Erosion occurred during magmatism and continued well into the early Eocene, with forearc sediments representing the products of this protracted unroofing of the arc. By calculating the depletion of Ca in forearc sediments relative to their arc protoliths, we estimate chemical weathering fluxes (in equivalent CO2) to be ∼106 mol km−2yr−1 near the end of magmatism, decreasing to ∼105 mol km−2yr−1 by the Early Eocene. Integrated over the entire magmatic and post-magmatic history of the batholith, the total amount of CO2 consumed through chemical weathering is comparable to that degassed. However, during magmatism, the regional degassing flux exceeds the regional weathering flux even though the efficiency of weathering is increased due to magmatic and tectonic uplift. After magmatism ends, continued erosion from remnant topography causes the arc to transition into a net regional sink, increasing the global efficiency of chemical weathering and amplifying cooling after magmatism ends. Understanding how atmospheric CO2 and climate vary over long timescales requires an understanding of how magmatic orogenies enhance degassing but also increase the strength of the global silicate weathering feedback.},

Even more uncertain is the timing and the secular trend of the emergence of most landmasses above the sea (subaerial landmasses), with estimates ranging from about one billion to three billion years ago5–7. The area of emerged crust influences global climate feedbacks and the supply of nutrients to the oceans8, and therefore connects Earth’s crustal evolution to surface environmental conditions9–11. Here we use the triple-oxygen-isotope composition of shales from all continents, spanning 3.7 billion years, to provide constraints on the emergence of continents over time. Our measurements show a stepwise total decrease of 0.08 per mille in the average triple-oxygen-isotope value of shales across the Archaean–Proterozoic boundary. We suggest that our data are best explained by a shift in the nature of water–rock interactions, from near-coastal in the Archaean era to predominantly continental in the Proterozoic, accompanied by a decrease in average surface temperatures. We propose that this shift may have coincided with the onset of a modern hydrological cycle owing to the rapid emergence of continental crust with near-modern average elevation and aerial extent roughly 2.5 billion years ago.},

	abstract = {Elemental fluxes to the ocean are expected to increase with the surface area of continental exposure to weathering and atmospheric PCO2. The record of phosphorus in sediments, which has no notable source within the ocean, and the radiogenic strontium isotopes in Archean carbonates indicate that, prior to the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), subaerial expanses represented only about 20\% of the modern continental surface area, i.e. 7\% of the surface of the Earth. Because these simple first-order observations, in contrast to the low oxygen content of the pre-GOE atmosphere, have so far received only little attention in the appraisal of the marine chemistry of the early Earth, a reassessment of the chemistry of the pre-GOE ocean is warranted. Here we discuss some of the geochemical cycles of the Archean world, including protons, alkalinity, electrons, and other electrolytes, and attempt to build a first conceptual framework for Chemical Archeoceanography. The smaller subaerial exposures characterizing the Archean and the low abundance of Archean carbonates and mudstones imply that the flux of alkalinity to the ocean was much weaker than today and therefore that the capacity of the runoff to neutralize the high-temperature hydrothermal fluids was less important. Such a reduced flux in turn entails lower seawater pH and higher chlorinity. The lack of atmospheric O2 allowed iron to be in its soluble Fe(II) form and to reduce HCO3− to CH4 while liberating large amounts of protons. The low pH of the pre-GOE ocean and the reduced alkalinity input, reinforced by scant P supply, account for reduced carbonate precipitation. Ocean chemistry evolved under the control of two changing factors: (i) the balance between chemical weathering and hydrothermal fluxes and (ii) the oxygen pressure in the ocean and the atmosphere. Seawater iron concentration was controlled by high [Fe2+]/[H+]2 ratios. With the temperature of hydrothermal fluids at mid-ocean ridges and other active volcanic edifices being determined by the expansion properties of seawater, the chemistry of hydrothermal fluids is controlled by the chlorinity of the ocean. Of all the major element cycles in seawater, those of Na, Mg, and P seem to be unbalanced when runoff falls below the modern value. The very low P content of banded iron formations is inconsistent with a major role of biological activity in the oxidation of Fe2+ dissolved in the Archean ocean. Prior to the GOE, banded iron formations were the major sedimentary sink of seawater cations, a role now played by carbonates. The controls of seawater alkalinity, which today are exerted by the Ca2+–CaCO3 couple, was exerted by dissolved Fe2+-magnetite or Fe2+-ferrihydrite.
Plain language summary
We here evaluate the constraints on seawater chemistry before free oxygen was introduced into the atmosphere some 2.4 billion years ago. We suggest a simple conceptual framework which we validated on modern seawater and which is based on two so-far largely overlooked observations, namely that the phosphorus concentration and strontium isotopic records in ancient sediments require that emerged continental land masses were covering only {\textasciitilde}7\% of Earth's surface at the time of the Great Oxidation Event instead of 30\% today. Atmospheric and seawater chemistry critically depend on this proportion as well as on the chlorinity of the ocean. The oxygen-free atmosphere allowed iron to remain in solution and to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to methane. The pH of the ancient oceans must have been lower because less river water was available to neutralize the acidic submarine high-temperature hydrothermal fluids emitted at mid-ocean ridges. Limited continental surface starved the sedimentary column for clays. The low pH and scant phosphorus drainage led to rare carbonate deposition. We conclude by proposing a new scheme for Archean marine chemistry and geochemical cycles that can explain the chemical and geological observations from the Archean and early Proterozoic rock record.},

Links between oxygenation and changes in the composition of continental crust during this time are suspected, but have been difficult to demonstrate. Here we constrain the average composition of the exposed continental crust since 3.7 billion years ago by compiling records of the Cr/U ratio of terrigenous sediments. The resulting record is consistent with a predominantly mafic crust prior to 3.0 billion years ago, followed by a 500- to 700-million-year transition to a crust of modern andesitic composition. Olivine and other Mg-rich minerals in the mafic Archaean crust formed serpentine minerals upon hydration, continuously releasing O2-scavenging agents such as dihydrogen, hydrogen sulfide and methane to the environment. Temporally, the decline in mafic crust capable of such process coincides with the first accumulation of O2 in the oceans, and subsequently the atmosphere. We therefore suggest that Earth’s early O2 cycle was ultimately limited by the composition of the exposed upper crust, and remained underdeveloped until modern andesitic continents emerged.},

	abstract = {Supracrustal rocks of the North Spirit Lake (NSL) greenstone belt comprise three stratigraphic units. The basal unit (Unit 1) consists of pillowed, massive and tuffaceous, tholeiitic basalts and komatiitic basalts (approximately 3.1Ga) with minor interbeds of greywacke and black pelite displaying characteristics of turbidites and mass flow deposits. REE patterns indicate basalt genesis at comparatively shallow depths (spinel-lherzolite field). Although REE patterns and other trace element characteristics are similar to N-MORBs, concentrations of REE's and Groups IV and V incompatible elements are somewhat lower than in average N-MORB, suggesting comparatively high degrees of partial melting of a fertile mantle. The evidence for an active hydrothermal system (black smoker and “Lost City” types) during the late stages of subaqueous volcanism, the lack of calc-alkaline characteristics for the NSL volcanic rocks, and the absence of geological evidence of a convergent margin setting, together suggest that the rocks of Unit 1 originated at a spreading centre, and represent ocean floor, generated at about 3Ga. Whether derived from a mantle plume or through upwelling mantle at a spreading centre, the source was more fertile than depleted MORB mantle. Sedimentary rocks of Units 1 and 2 provide evidence of a mixed compositional source that included intra-basinal basaltic material and an exotic tonalitic component. Sedimentary rocks of Unit 3 are derived almost exclusively from a tonalitic source, with derived sediments ranging from highly mineralogically mature to very immature. In spite of the highly active tectonic setting (i.e., rapid denudation rates), alumina-rich pelites are present in all the three Units, implying exceptionally rapid chemical weathering rates in the (tonalitic) source lands. Rapid weathering may be explained by a high CO2 content in the Archean atmosphere. There is about a 300Ma interval between Unit 1 volcanism at approximately 3.1Ga, and igneous activity represented by the Bijou Point Complex which intrude rocks of Unit 3 at about 2.7Ga. The basal volcanic rocks resemble MORBs whereas the young volcanic rocks are potassic and of calc-alkaline affinity. Although the rocks of the two basal units appear to have formed in or near a spreading center, the rocks of Unit 3 likely were produced in a subduction environment such as those found in island arcs or some continental margin settings. Together, the three units resemble products of a Wilson Cycle, operating between 3.1 and 2.7Ga, with the calc-alkaline Bijou Point Igneous Complex representing terminal volcanism. Proof or rejection of this hypothesis requires additional detailed mapping, geochemical and geochronological investigations.},

Mafic volcanics occupy the base of the sequence. The greywackes are predominantly tuffacious containing chlorite-sericite and hornblende. Arkosic variations containing biotite dominate the western part of the sector. Fine-grained variations occur as isolated narrow lenses within other types of greywackes. The conglomeratic greywackes are localized along the western and the eastern margins of the sector. All of the greywackes are all typically immature containing coarser clasts of mostly plagioclase (18–23\%) and quartz (32–34\%). Lithic fragments of felsic volcanic rocks are common. The matrix is dominated by mafic material. Biotite and amphibole are related to metamorphic recrystallization. Chlorite, sericite, epidote, carbonate and chert are products of the interplay of diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism. Fe-Ti oxide, sphene, apatite and zircon are usual accessories. But for slight enrichment in K2O, the major element chemistry of the GDS greywackes is similar to the chemistry of Late Archaean greywackes. They also compare in respect of V, Co, Hf contents, K2O/Na2O, SiO2/Al2O3, Na2O/Al2O3, Ba/Rb, Th/U, La/Th, Sm/Nd ratios, steep REE patterns with distinct LREE enrichment and HREE depletion. The GDS greywackes however are distinctly enriched in Rb, Ba, Sr, Th, U, Cu, Zr, Ce/Ce* and depleted in Cr, Ni, and Zn. The conglomeritic and biotite bearing verities contain considerable proportions of clasts derived from the basement tonalitic/granitic terrain. The common tuffacious greywackes containing hornblende and biotite-sericite however include only volcanic clasts and bear evidence of derivation from submarine weathering of predominantly felsic volcanics erupted on a large scale to form a magmatic arc in the later stages of geosynclinal deposition. Geochemical data suggest that the GDS greywackes were laid down in progressively changing basin geometry from a passive to active continental margin and island arc setting.},

The phyllites are strongly depleted in CaO, Na2O, and Sr with respect to average Archean upper crust. By contrast, K2O, Ba, and Rb are enriched several times relative to average Archean upper crust, reflecting basin-scale K metasomatism. Transition metals are somewhat depleted, whereas high field strength elements are typically enriched relative to average Archean upper crust. Samples generally have fractionated LREE patterns (average CeN/SmN = 2.4) with small negative Eu anomalies (average Eu/Eu* = 0.78) and generally flat HREEs (average GdN/ YbN = 1.3). Such geochemical characteristics suggest that the source dominantly consisted of tonalite with less common occurrences mafic volcanic rocks and granite. Mixing calculations, which massbalance the REEs and Th/Sc, suggest 70\% tonalite, 15\% mafic volcanic rocks, and 15\% granite as possible proportions for the source of the phyllites. A nearby early Archean ({\textasciitilde}3.5 Ga) continental nucleus preserves similar lithologies and is the probable source. Intense chemical weathering of the source terrane is indicated by premetasomatized chemical index of alteration values of 95–100, nearly complete depletion of CaO and Na2O, and high Al2O3/Na2O ratios.

	abstract = {Evolutionary developments among vascular land plants may have been the ultimate cause for oceanic anoxic events, biotic crises, global climate change, and geochemical and sedimentologic anomalies of Late Devonian age. The influence of vascular land plants on weathering processes and global geochemical cycles is likely to have increased substantially during the Late Devonian owing to large increases in root biomass associated with development of (1) arborescence (tree-sized stature), which increased root penetration depths, and (2) the seed habit, which allowed colonization of drier upland areas. We hypothesize that rapidly increasing root mass led to transient intensification of the rate of soil formation and to permanent gains in the thickness and areal extent of deeply weathered soil profiles. In the short term, greater pedogenesis caused increased sediment yields owing to episodic disturbance of developing soils and to increased nutrient fluxes to the oceans as a result of enhanced chemical weathering. Long-term effects included increased landscape stabilization, drawdown of atmospheric CO2 through enhanced uptake in silicate weathering and burial of organic carbon, and global cooling. Coeval terrestrial paleobotanic developments and marine anoxic and extinction events are likely to have been linked causally through transient nutrient pulses that caused eutrophication of semirestricted epicontinental seaways, stimulating marine algal blooms. Correlativity of black shale horizons and episodes of extinction of tropical marine benthos implicates oceanic anoxia rather than global cooling as the proximate cause of the Late Devonian biotic crisis.},

Copper and Ag concentrations in magmas are largely controlled by sulﬁde dissolution during melting and sulﬁde fractionation during diﬀerentiation. We show that Cu is high in basalts but low in komatiites and felsic rocks, making Cu useful for constraining the proportion of basalts in the UCC. Furthermore, Cu/Ag ratios are high in basalts and komatiites but decrease with diﬀerentiation. The ﬁne-grained matrix of ancient glacial diamictites shows dramatic declines in both Cu concentrations and Cu/Ag ratios at 3.0–2.4 Ga, after which diamictite Cu concentrations and Cu/Ag ratios remain roughly constant. Mass-balance calculations using average Cu concentrations of Archean komatiites, basalts and felsic rocks require that a high proportion basalt (65–75\%) was present in the UCC at \$3.0 Ga, and this crust transitioned to a felsic-rock-dominated crust at \$2.4 Ga ago and has remained basically unchanged since then. This conclusion is supported by the consistency between the Cu/Ag ratios in the diamictites and the weighted average Cu/Ag ratios based on the lithological proportions obtained using Cu mass-balance calculations. Our observations document the emergence of felsic continental crust in the late Archean, which, in turn, indicates a fundamental change in Earth’s dynamic regime at that time.},

	abstract = {The inception of plate tectonics on Earth and its subsequent evolution are discussed on the basis of theoretical considerations and observational constraints. The likelihood of plate tectonics in the past depends on what mechanism is responsible for the relatively constant surface heat flux that is indicated by the likely thermal history of Earth. The continuous operation of plate tectonics throughout Earth's history is possible if, for example, the strength of convective stress in the mantle is affected by the gradual subduction of surface water. Various geological indicators for the emergence of plate tectonics are evaluated from a geodynamical perspective, and they invariably involve certain implicit assumptions about mantle dynamics, which are either demonstrably wrong or yet to be explored. The history of plate tectonics is suggested to be intrinsically connected to the secular evolution of the atmosphere, through sea-level changes caused by ocean-mantle interaction.},

The chemistry of Neogene sediments from the main locus of sedimentary deposition for Himalayan detritus, the Bengal Fan, can be used to estimate the sinks of CO2 from silicate weathering and from the weathering and burial of organic carbon resulting from Himalayan uplift. Here we show that Neogene CO2 consumption from the net burial of organic carbon during Himalayan sediment deposition was 2–3 times that resulting from the weathering of Himalayan silicates. Thus the dominant effect of Neogene Himalayan erosion on the carbon cycle is an increase in the amount of organic carbon in the sedimentary reservoir, not an increase in silicate weathering fluxes.},

	abstract = {Mountain building results in high erosion rates and the interaction of rocks with the atmosphere, water and life. Carbon transfers that result from increased erosion could control the evolution of Earth’s long-term climate. For decades, attention has focused on the hypothesized role of mountain building in drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) via silicate weathering. However, it is now recognized that mountain building and erosion affect the carbon cycle in other important ways. For example, erosion mobilizes organic carbon (OC) from terrestrial vegetation, transferring it to rivers and sediments, and thereby acting to draw down atmospheric CO2 in tandem with silicate weathering. Meanwhile, exhumation of sedimentary rocks can release CO2 through the oxidation of rock OC and sulfide minerals. In this Review, we examine the mechanisms of carbon exchange between rocks and the atmosphere, and discuss the balance of CO2 sources and sinks. It is demonstrated that OC burial and oxidative weathering, not widely considered in most models, control the net CO2 budget associated with erosion. Lithology strongly influences the impact of mountain building on the global carbon cycle, with an orogeny dominated by sedimentary rocks, and thus abundant rock OC and sulfides, tending towards being a CO2 source.},

Three separate observations, from sedimentary rock compositions, subduction zone igneous rocks and heat flow constraints combine to suggest that the composition of the Archaean crust was distinct from that of the present-day continental crust. The sedimentary REE patterns are consistent with derivation of the upper crust from a 1:1 mixture of the Archaean bimodal basic-felsic suite. The andesite model, while adequate to account for present-day continental growth does not provide enough Cr and Ni for the Archaean crust. Average crustal component heat flow values of 14 mW m−2 for Archaean terrains are significantly lower than the post-Archaean average of 23 mW m−2 for crustally produced heat.
Correlations from the sedimentary trace element data provide Archaean upper crustal values of 1.5\% K, 5.7 ppm Th and 1.5 ppm U. Heat flow constraints restrict such compositions to the upper layers. The total crustal values are consistent with a 2:1 basic/felsic composition, and give values for the total crust of 0.75\% K, 2.9 ppm Th and 0.75 ppm U, which provide crustal heat flow components of 14 mW m−2 for a 30 km thick crust and 19 mW m−2 for a 40 km crust.},

These types include acid (0.98\% at global scale) and basic (5.75\%) volcanics, acid (7.23\%) and basic (0.20\%) plutonics, Precambrian basement (11.52\%) and metamorphic rocks (4.07\%), consolidated siliciclastic rocks (16.28\%), mixed sedimentary (7.75\%), carbonates (10.40\%), semi- to un-consolidated sedimentary rocks (10.05\%), alluvial deposits (15.48\%), loess (2.62\%), dunes (1.54\%) and evaporites (0.12\%). Where sediments, volcanics and metamorphosed rocks are too intimately mixed, a complex lithology (5.45\%) class is added. Average composition is then tabulated for continents, ocean drainage basins, relief types (n = 7), 10° latitudinal bands, geological periods (n = 7), and exorheic versus endorheic domain and for formerly glaciated regions. Surficial lithology is highly heterogeneous and major differences are noted in any of these ensembles. Expected findings include the importance of alluvium and unconsolidated deposits in plains and lowlands, of Precambrian and metamorphic rocks in mid-mountain areas, the occurrence of loess, dunes and evaporites in dry regions, and of carbonates in Europe. Less expected are the large occurrences of volcanics (74\% of their outcrops) in highly dissected relief and the importance of loess in South America. Prevalence of carbonate rocks between 15°N and 65°N and of Precambrian plus metamorphics in two bands (25°S–15°N and north of 55°N) is confirmed. Asia and the Atlantic Ocean drainage basin, without Mediterranean and Black Sea, are the most representative ensembles.

The composition of continental crust far back in Earth's history gives us insight into when plate tectonics ramped up and has influenced ocean chemistry. Greber et al. looked at titanium isotopes in shales, which form from eroded continental crustal sediments, to estimate the composition 3.5 billion years ago, closer to the origins of Earth. They found a silica-rich composition, which indicates that plate tectonics was happening deep in our distant past. Other changes in crustal composition might be linked to changing ocean chemistry and major events such as the oxygenation of our atmosphere.
Science, this issue p. 1271
Earth exhibits a dichotomy in elevation and chemical composition between the continents and ocean floor. Reconstructing when this dichotomy arose is important for understanding when plate tectonics started and how the supply of nutrients to the oceans changed through time. We measured the titanium isotopic composition of shales to constrain the chemical composition of the continental crust exposed to weathering and found that shales of all ages have a uniform isotopic composition. This can only be explained if the emerged crust was predominantly felsic (silica-rich) since 3.5 billion years ago, requiring an early initiation of plate tectonics. We also observed a change in the abundance of biologically important nutrients phosphorus and nickel across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, which might have helped trigger the rise in atmospheric oxygen.

Several studies relying on trace element data concluded that the Archaean crust was predominantly mafic, while Ti isotope systematics point to an Archaean crust that was predominantly felsic. Here, we resolve the inconsistency between these two approaches by applying a novel statistical method to a compilation of published elemental concentrations in terrigenous sediments (the OrTeS database). We use a filter based on the Local Outlier Factor to reject sediment samples that have been affected by alteration processes or mineral fractionation during transport. The nature of the emerged continents is calculated using an inverse mixing model based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. A procedure is presented to automatically select elemental ratios that are best suited for constraining the sediment provenance. We find that for all systems that accurately reconstruct the modern-day composition of the continents, a continuous {\textgreater}50\% felsic contribution is required to explain the composition of fine-grained terrigenous sediments starting from 3.5 billion years ago. This finding is consistent with an early onset of plate tectonics. We estimate the geothermal gradient in the Archaean upper continental crust by tracking the reconstructed concentrations of the radiogenic heat-producing elements K, U, and Th through time. Radioactive heat production in the bulk continental crust was 50\% higher in the Archaean compared to the present, resulting in a continental geothermal gradient that was about 40\% higher.},

	abstract = {The elemental composition of a sediment is set by the composition of its protolith and modified by weathering, sorting, and diagenesis. An important problem is deconvolving these contributions to a sediment's composition to arrive at information about processes that operate on the Earth's surface. We approach this problem by developing a predictive and invertible model of sedimentary major element composition. We compile a data set of sedimentary rock, river sediment, soil, and igneous rock compositions. Principal component analysis of the data set shows that most variation can be simplified to a small number of variables. We thus show that any sediment's composition can be described with just two vectors of igneous evolution and weathering. We hence define a model for sedimentary composition as a combination of these processes. A 1:1 correspondence is observed between predictions and independent data. The log ratios and are found to be simple proxies for, respectively, the model's protolith and weathering indices. Significant deviations from the model can be explained by sodium-calcium exchange. Using this approach, we show that the major element composition of the upper continental crust has been modified by weathering, and we calculate the amount of each element that it must have lost to modify it to its present composition. By extrapolating modern weathering rates over the age of the crust, we conclude that it has not retained a significant amount of the necessarily produced weathering restite. This restite has likely been subducted into the mantle, indicating a crust-to-mantle recycling rate of 1.33 ± 0.89 ×1013 kg·year−1.},

	abstract = {Controversy over the oxygen isotope composition of seawater began in the 1950's, since which time there has been no agreement over whether the oxygen isotope composition of the oceans has changed over time. Resolving this uncertainty would allow the δ18O values of demonstrably well preserved marine authigenic precipitates to be used to reconstruct surface climate trends back to early Archean times and would help towards a more quantitative description of Earth's global water cycle on geological time scales. Isotopic studies of marine carbonate and silica reveal a trend of increasing δ18O values with decreasing age since the Archean. This trend has been interpreted by some to reflect a progressive increase in seawater δ18O through time; however, it is generally accepted on the basis of ophiolite studies and theoretical considerations that seawater δ18O cannot change significantly because of the buffering effects of ocean crust alteration at mid-ocean ridges. As a result many alternative interpretations have been proposed, including meteoric alteration; warmer paleoclimates; higher seawater pH; salinity stratification and biased sampling. Here we review these interpretations in the light of an updated compilation of marine carbonate δ18O from around the world, covering the Phanerozoic and Precambrian rock records. Recent models of the geological water cycle demonstrate how long-term trends in chemical weathering and hydrothermal circulation can indeed influence the O-isotope composition of the global ocean to the extent necessary to explain the carbonate δ18O trend, with residual variation attributed to climatic fluctuations and post-depositional alteration. We present the further development of an existing model of the geological water cycle. In the model, seawater δ18O increased from about −13.3‰ to −0.3‰ over a period of 3.4 Ga, with average surface temperatures fluctuating between 10 °C to 33 °C, which is consistent with known biological constraints. Similar temperature variations are also obtained, although with higher starting seawater δ18O composition, when more conservative approaches are used that take into account the systematic effects of diagenetic alteration on mean calcite δ18O values. In contrast to much published opinion, the average δ18O value of ocean crust in the model remained relatively unchanged throughout all model runs. Invariable ophiolite δ18O values can, therefore, not be used as a definitive argument against changing seawater δ18O. The most likely explanation for the long-term trend in seawater δ18O invokes two stepwise increases in the ratio of high- to low-temperature fluid/rock interactions. An initial increase may have occurred close to the Archean–Proterozoic boundary, but a possibly more significant increase took place near the Proterozoic–Phanerozoic boundary. Possible explanations for extremely low seawater δ18O during the Archean include higher continental weathering rates caused by a combination of higher atmospheric pCO2 (necessarily combined with high CO2 outgassing rates), a greater abundance of relatively easily weathered volcanic rocks in greenstone belts and partial emergence of spreading ridges. The second increase may have been caused by the suppression of low-temperature overprinting of ocean crust alteration by the formation of a thick sediment cover on ridge flanks due to the emergence of shelly plankton at the beginning of the Phanerozoic. Postulated increases in spreading ridge depths since the Archean would also have enhanced the efficiency of vertical heat flux and changed the depth at which hydrothermal fluids boil, both of which would favour high- over low-temperature interactions with time.},

Mudrocks such as slate and shale are rarely found in stratigraphy older than about 500 million years. McMahon and Davies compiled a large database of mudrock occurrence over the past 3.5 billion years to help assess the origin of this ubiquitous rock type (see the Perspective by Fischer). Mudrocks appeared at the same time as did deep-rooted land plants. The interplay between plants and sedimentary rocks suggests that a change in erosion rate and the chemistry of sediments delivered to the oceans occurred around 500 million years ago.
Science, this issue p. 1022; see also p. 994
Mudrocks are a primary archive of Earth’s history from the Archean eon to recent times, and their source-to-sink production and deposition play a central role in long-term ocean chemistry and climate regulation. Using original and published stratigraphic data from all 704 of Earth’s known alluvial formations from the Archean eon (3.5 billion years ago) to the Carboniferous period (0.3 billion years ago), we prove contentions of an upsurge in the proportion of mud retained on land coeval with vegetation evolution. We constrain the onset of the upsurge to the Ordovician-Silurian and show that alluvium deposited after land plant evolution contains a proportion of mudrock that is, on average, 1.4 orders of magnitude greater than the proportion contained in alluvium from the preceding 90\% of Earth’s history. We attribute this shift to the ways in which vegetation revolutionized mud production and sediment flux from continental interiors.
Rooted land plants appear to help reduce erosion rate and promote mudrock lithification.

Science, this issue p. 181; see also p. 126
On multimillion-year time scales, Earth has experienced warm ice-free and cold glacial climates, but it is unknown whether transitions between these background climate states were the result of changes in carbon dioxide sources or sinks. Low-latitude arc-continent collisions are hypothesized to drive cooling by exhuming and eroding mafic and ultramafic rocks in the warm, wet tropics, thereby increasing Earth’s potential to sequester carbon through chemical weathering. To better constrain global weatherability through time, the paleogeographic position of all major Phanerozoic arc-continent collisions was reconstructed and compared to the latitudinal distribution of ice sheets. This analysis reveals a strong correlation between the extent of glaciation and arc-continent collisions in the tropics. Earth’s climate state is set primarily by global weatherability, which changes with the latitudinal distribution of arc-continent collisions.
Phanerozoic glacial climates occurred during intervals of extensive arc-continent collision in the tropics.

The paper records the development of regional geochemical surveys, or mapping, in the context of spatial scale and transition from a mineral exploration and resource assessment tool to an environmental mapping exercise supporting multi-disciplinary research. Attention is drawn to the role of the International Geological Correlation Program’s Projects 259 and 360, and the continuing role of the International Union of Geological Sciences, in providing an international focus and dimension to global geochemical mapping.

	abstract = {Weathering of silicate minerals impacts many geological and ecological processes. For example, the weathering of basalt contributes significantly to consumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and must be included in global calculations of such consumption over geological timeframes. Here we compare weathering advance rates for basalt (wDβ), where D and β indicate the scale at which the rate is determined and surface area measured, respectively, from the laboratory to the watershed scales. Data collected at the laboratory, weathering rind, soil profile and watershed scales show that weathering advance rate of basalt is a fractal property that can be described by a fractal dimension (dr≈2.3). By combining the fractal description of rates with an Arrhenius relationship for basalt weathering, we derive the following equation to predict weathering advance rates at any spatial scale from weathering advance rates measured at the BET scale:wDβ=k0(βa)dr−2e−Ea/RT. Here, k0 is the pre-exponential factor (1.29×107 mm3 mm−2 yr−1), Ea is the activation energy (70 kj mol−1), and a is a spatial constant related to the scale of measurement of BET surface area (10−7 mm). The term, (βa)dr−2, is the roughness. The roughness fractal dimension can be conceptualized as a factor related to both the thickness of the reaction front and the specific surface area within the reaction front. However, the above equation can also be written in terms of a surface fractal dimension and the hypothetical average grain radius. These fractal dimensions provide insight into reaction front geometry and should vary with lithology. Once the surface area discrepancy has been accounted for using this method, we find a one to two order of magnitude range in weathering advance rates measured at any scale or temperature that can be attributed to factors such as changes in erosional regime, parent lithology, mechanism, climate, composition of reacting fluid, and biological activity. Our scaled equation, when used to predict global basalt CO2 consumption based upon global lithologic maps, yields an uptake flux (1.75×1013 mol CO2 yr−1) within the predicted error of fluxes estimated based upon riverine measurements.},

To estimate environmental impact, heavy metal concentrations in stream sediments can be utilized because they are indicators of contamination and change negligibly with time. This study proposes a new Kriging method to predict heavy metal concentrations in stream sediments. The proposed methods compensate for the drawbacks of Kriging based on Euclidean distance because they utilize the stream distance for the prediction by analyzing the stream path and networks using digital elevation models. Moreover, the developed method reduces the exaggeration problem in predicting the concentration of an uncontaminated stream segment by considering the catchment basin area in Kriging. Application of these methods to synthetic and real-world datasets proves that they exhibit improvement in terms of overall error reduction, and they provide reasonable predictions at stream junctions, rather than Kriging based on Euclidean distance.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11194},
	abstract = {Where data is available, it is desirable in geostatistical modelling to make use of additional covariates, for example terrain data, in order to improve prediction accuracy in the modelling task. While elevation itself may be important, additional explanatory power for any given problem can be sought (but not necessarily found) by filtering digital elevation models to extact higher-order derivatives such as slope angles, curvatures, and roughness. In essence, it would be beneficial to extract as much task-relevant information as possible from the elevation grid. However, given the complexities of the natural world, chance dictates that the use of 'off-the-shelf' filters is unlikely to derive covariates that provide strong explanatory power to the target variable at hand, and any attempt to manually design informative covariates is likely to be a trial-and-error process -- not optimal. In this paper we present a solution to this problem in the form of a deep learning approach to automatically deriving optimal task-specific terrain texture covariates from a standard SRTM 90m gridded digital elevation model (DEM). For our target variables we use point-sampled geochemical data from the British Geological Survey: concentrations of potassium, calcium and arsenic in stream sediments. We find that our deep learning approach produces covariates for geostatistical modelling that have surprisingly strong explanatory power on their own, with R-squared values around 0.6 for all three elements (with arsenic on the log scale). These results are achieved without the neural network being provided with easting, northing, or absolute elevation as inputs, and purely reflect the capacity of our deep neural network to extract task-specific information from terrain texture. We hope that these results will inspire further investigation into the capabilities of deep learning within geostatistical applications.},

The performances of a series of MLAs, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs), regression trees (RTs), random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVMs) in mineral prospectivity modelling are compared based on the following criteria: i) the accuracy in the delineation of prospective areas; ii) the sensitivity to the estimation of hyper-parameters; iii) the sensitivity to the size of training data; and iv) the interpretability of model parameters. The results of applying the above algorithms to epithermal Au prospectivity mapping of the Rodalquilar district, Spain, indicate that the RF outperformed the other MLA algorithms (ANNs, RTs and SVMs). The RF algorithm showed higher stability and robustness with varying training parameters and better success rates and ROC analysis results. On the other hand, all MLA algorithms can be used when ore deposit evidences are scarce. Moreover the model parameters of RF and RT can be interpreted to gain insights into the geological controls of mineralization.},

	abstract = {In order to understand the evolution of the crust-mantle system, it is important to recognize the role played by the recycling of continental crust. Crustal recycling can be considered as two fundamentally distinct processes: 1) intracrustal recycling and 2) crust-mantle recycling. Intracrustal recycling is the turnover of crustal material by processes taking place wholly within the crust and includes most sedimentary recycling, isotopic resetting (metamorphism), intracrustal melting and assimilation. Crust-mantle recycling is the transfer of crustal material to the mantle with possible subsequent return to the crust. Intracrustal recycling is important in interpreting secular changes in sediment composition through time. It also explains differences found in crustal area--age patterns measured by different isotopic systems and may also play a role in modeling crustal growth curves based on Nd-model ages. Crustal-mantle recycling, for the most part, is a subduction process and may be considered on three levels. The first is recycling with only short periods of time in the mantle ( {\textless} 10 m.y.). This may be important in explaining the origin of island-arc and related igneous rocks; there is growing agreement that 1-3\% recycled sediment is involved in their origin. Components of recycled crustal material, with long-term storage (up to 2.5 b.y.) in the mantle as distinct entities, has been suggested for the origin of ocean island and ultrapotassic volcanics but there is considerably less agreement on this interpretation. A third proposal calls for the return of crustal material to the mantle with efficient remixing in order to swamp the geochemical and isotopic signature of the recycled component by the mantle. This type of recycling is required for steady-state models of crustal evolution where the mass of the continents remains constant over geological time. It is unlikely if crust-mantle recycling has exceeded 0.75 km3/yr over the past 1-2 Ga.},

	abstract = {Resolving the modes of mantle convection through Earth history, i.e. when plate tectonics started and what kind of mantle dynamics reigned before, is essential to the understanding of the evolution of the whole Earth system, because plate tectonics influences almost all aspects of modern geological processes. This is a challenging problem because plate tectonics continuously rejuvenates Earth's surface on a time scale of about 100 Myr, destroying evidence for its past operation. It thus becomes essential to exploit indirect evidence preserved in the buoyant continental crust, part of which has survived over billions of years. This contribution starts with an in-depth review of existing models for continental growth. Growth models proposed so far can be categorized into three types: crust-based, mantle-based and other less direct inferences, and the first two types are particularly important as their difference reflects the extent of crustal recycling, which can be related to subduction. Then, a theoretical basis for a change in the mode of mantle convection in the Precambrian is reviewed, along with a critical appraisal of some popular notions for early Earth dynamics. By combining available geological and geochemical observations with geodynamical considerations, a tentative hypothesis is presented for the evolution of mantle dynamics and its relation to surface environment; the early onset of plate tectonics and gradual mantle hydration are responsible not only for the formation of continental crust but also for its preservation as well as its emergence above sea level. Our current understanding of various material properties and elementary processes is still too premature to build a testable, quantitative model for this hypothesis, but such modelling efforts could potentially transform the nature of the data-starved early Earth research by quantifying the extent of preservation bias.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Earth dynamics and the development of plate tectonics’.},

Arsenic is a metabolic poison that is present in minute quantities in most rock materials and, under certain natural conditions, can accumulate in aquifers and cause adverse health effects. Podgorski and Berg used measurements of arsenic in groundwater from ∼80 previous studies to train a machine-learning model with globally continuous predictor variables, including climate, soil, and topography (see the Perspective by Zheng). The output global map reveals the potential for hazard from arsenic contamination in groundwater, even in many places where there are sparse or no reported measurements. The highest-risk regions include areas of southern and central Asia and South America. Understanding arsenic hazard is especially essential in areas facing current or future water insecurity.
Science, this issue p. 845; see also p. 818
Naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater affects millions of people worldwide. We created a global prediction map of groundwater arsenic exceeding 10 micrograms per liter using a random forest machine-learning model based on 11 geospatial environmental parameters and more than 50,000 aggregated data points of measured groundwater arsenic concentration. Our global prediction map includes known arsenic-affected areas and previously undocumented areas of concern. By combining the global arsenic prediction model with household groundwater-usage statistics, we estimate that 94 million to 220 million people are potentially exposed to high arsenic concentrations in groundwater, the vast majority (94\%) being in Asia. Because groundwater is increasingly used to support growing populations and buffer against water scarcity due to changing climate, this work is important to raise awareness, identify areas for safe wells, and help prioritize testing.
A global model for predicting groundwater arsenic levels suggests that 94 million to 220 million people are at risk of exposure.

These environmental conditions can leave behind imprints in the Earth's sedimentary archive, but signals of climate, tectonic, and biologic change are not always present in the stratigraphic record. Deterministic and stochastic surface dynamics collectively act as a stratigraphic filter, impeding the burial and preservation of environmental signals in sedimentary deposits. Such impediments form a central challenge to accurately reconstructing environmental conditions through Earth's history. Emergent and self-organized length and timescales in landscapes, which are themselves influenced by regional environmental conditions, define spatial and temporal sedimentation patterns in basins and fundamentally control the likelihood of environmental signal preservation in sedimentary deposits. Properly characterizing these scales provides a key avenue for incorporating the known ?imperfections? of the stratigraphic record into paleoenvironmental reconstructions. These insights are necessary for answering both basic and applied science questions, including our ability to reconstruct the Earth system response to prior episodes of climate, tectonic, or land cover change.},

The geomorphic and stratigraphic products of this source-to-sink sediment transfer record signals of external environmental forcings, as well as internal, or autogenic, dynamics of the sedimentary system. Here, we evaluate environmental signal propagation across sediment-routing systems with emphasis on sediment supply, Qs, as the carrier of up-system forcings. We review experimental, numerical, and natural examples of source-to-sink sediment routing and signal propagation during three timescales: (1) historic, which includes measurement and monitoring of events and processes of landscape change and deposition during decades to centuries; (2) centuries to several millions of years, referred to as intermediate timescale; and (3) deep time. We discuss issues related to autogenic dynamics of sediment transport, transient storage, and release that can introduce noise, lags, and/or completely mask signals of external environmental forcings. We provide a set of conceptual and practical tools for evaluating sediment supply within a source-to-sink context, which can inform interpretations of signals from the sedimentary record. These tools include stratigraphic and sediment-routing system characterization, sediment budgets, geochronology, detrital mineral analysis (e.g., thermochronology), comparative analog approaches, and modeling techniques to measure, calculate, or estimate the magnitude and frequency of external forcings compared to the characteristic response time of the sediment-routing systems.},

	abstract = {The classical approach to sandstone petrology, established in the golden years of plate tectonics and based on the axiom that “detrital modes of sandstone suites primarily reflect the different tectonic settings of provenance terranes,” has represented a benchmark for decades. The composition of sand and sandstone, however, simply provides us with a distorted image of the lithological structure of source terranes and gives us little clue whether they are allochthonous or autochthonous, orogenic or anorogenic, young or old. What we may able to see reflected in detrital modes is the nature of source terranes (continental, arc, oceanic) and the tectonostratigraphic level reached by erosion in space and time. The proposed new approach to the petrology of sand and sandstone (1) starts with a simple classification scheme circulated since the 1960s, which is purely descriptive, objective, and free of ill-defined ambiguous terms and (2) focuses on the nature and tectonostratigraphic level of source terranes. Further steps are essential to upgrade provenance analysis. Acquiring knowledge from modern settings is needed to properly identify and wherever possible correct for physical and chemical processes introducing environmental and diagenetic bias and thus address nature's complexities with adequate conceptual tools. Equally important is the integration of multiple techniques, ideally including bulk-sediment, multi-mineral, and single-mineral methods. Bulk-sediment petrography remains the fundamental approach that allows us to capture the most precious source of direct provenance information, represented by the mineralogy and texture of rock fragments. Bulk-sediment geochemistry, applicable also to silt and clay carried in suspension, is a superior method to check for hydraulic sorting, chemical weathering, and fertility of detrital minerals in different sediment sources. Detrital geochronology, thermochronology, and isotope geochemistry reveal the diverse time structures of source rocks and have become necessary complementary techniques in modern provenance analysis. Inferences on geodynamic processes need independent geological information and come last, but if tackled properly, they can lead us much farther than the standard label obtained by using triangular diagrams uncritically as if they were infallible oracles.},

	abstract = {This report presents the results of an urban drainage geochemical survey carried out jointly by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and Glasgow City Council (GCC) during June 2003. 118 stream sediment and 122 surface water samples were collected at a sample density of 1 per 1 km2 from all tributaries draining into the River Clyde within the GCC administrative area. The study was carried out as part of the BGS systematic Geochemical Surveys of Urban Environments (GSUE) programme.
Stream sediment and surface water samples underwent analysis for approximately 46 chemical elements including contaminants such as As, Al, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn according to standard GSUE procedures. In addition, parameters such as ammonium, asbestos and Hg as well as organic contaminants such as total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and organo-tin compounds were assessed.
The aim of the project was to provide an overview of urban drainage geochemistry in Glasgow to link to an on-going sister project, which is investigating the geochemistry of the Clyde estuary. This report presents the initial findings of the Clyde tributaries survey but it is envisaged that the data will be interpreted in more detail as part of a wider Clyde basin study once the Clyde estuary survey is completed.},

	abstract = {If we accept that a critical condition for plate tectonics is the creation and maintenance of a global network of narrow boundaries separating multiple plates, then to argue for plate tectonics during the Archean requires more than a local record of subduction. A case is made for plate tectonics back to the early Paleoproterozoic, when a cycle of breakup and collision led to formation of the supercontinent Columbia, and bimodal metamorphism is registered globally. Before this, less preserved crust and survivorship bias become greater concerns, and the geological record may yield only a lower limit on the emergence of plate tectonics. Higher mantle temperature in the Archean precluded or limited stable subduction, requiring a transition to plate tectonics from another tectonic mode. This transition is recorded by changes in geochemical proxies and interpreted based on numerical modeling. Improved understanding of the secular evolution of temperature and water in the mantle are key targets for future research. ▪Higher mantle temperature in the Archean precluded or limited stable subduction, requiring a transition to plate tectonics from another tectonic mode. ▪Plate tectonics can be demonstrated on Earth since the early Paleoproterozoic (since c. 2.2 Ga), but before the Proterozoic Earth's tectonic mode remains ambiguous. ▪The Mesoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic (3.2–2.3 Ga) represents a period of transition from an early tectonic mode (stagnant or sluggish lid) to plate tectonics. ▪The development of a global network of narrow boundaries separating multiple plates could have been kick-started by plume-induced subduction.

Here we show that the slow ∼50 Wm−2 increase in TSI over the last ∼420 million years (an increase of ∼9 Wm−2 of radiative forcing) was almost completely negated by a long-term decline in atmospheric CO2. This was likely due to the silicate weathering-negative feedback and the expansion of land plants that together ensured Earth’s long-term habitability. Humanity’s fossil-fuel use, if unabated, risks taking us, by the middle of the twenty-first century, to values of CO2 not seen since the early Eocene (50 million years ago). If CO2 continues to rise further into the twenty-third century, then the associated large increase in radiative forcing, and how the Earth system would respond, would likely be without geological precedent in the last half a billion years.},

	abstract = {Geodynamic models of mantle convection predict that Mexico and western North America share a history of dynamic support. We calculate admittance between gravity and topography, which indicates that the elastic thickness of the plate in Mexico is 11 km and in western North America it is 12 km. Admittance at wavelengths {\textgreater} 500 km in these regions suggests that topography is partly supported by subcrustal processes. These results corroborate estimates of residual topography from isostatic calculations and suggest that the amount of North American topography supported by the mantle may exceed 1 km. The Cenozoic history of magmatism, sedimentary flux, thermochronometric denudation estimates, and uplifted marine terraces imply that North American lithosphere was uplifted and eroded during the last 30 Ma. We jointly invert 533 Mexican and North American longitudinal river profiles to reconstruct a continent-scale rock uplift rate history. Uplift rate is permitted to vary in space and time. Erosional parameters are calibrated using incision rate data in southwest Mexico and the Colorado Plateau. Calculated rock uplift rates were 0.15–0.2 mm/yr between 25 and10 Ma. Central Mexico experienced the highest uplift rates. Central and southern Mexico continued to uplift at 0.1 mm/yr until recent times. This uplift history is corroborated by independent constraints. We predict clastic flux to the Gulf of Mexico and compare it to independent estimates. We tentatively suggest that the loop between uplift, erosion, and deposition can be closed here. Mexico's staged uplift history suggests that its dynamic support has changed during the last 30 Ma.},

Upslope area is then calculated by proportioning flow between two downslope pixels according to how close this flow direction is to the direct angle to the downslope pixel. This procedure offers improvements over prior procedures that have restricted flow to eight possible directions (introducing grid bia) or proportioned flow according to slope (introducing unrealistic dispersion). The new procedure is more robust than prior procedures based on fitting local planes while retaining a simple grid based structure.

	abstract = {The longitudinal profiles of bedrock channels are a major component of the relief structure of mountainous drainage basins and therefore limit the elevation of peaks and ridges. Further, bedrock channels communicate tectonic and climatic signals across the landscape, thus dictating, to first order, the dynamic response of mountainous landscapes to external forcings. We review and explore the stream-power erosion model in an effort to (1) elucidate its consequences in terms of large-scale topographic (fluvial) relief and its sensitivity to tectonic and climatic forcing, (2) derive a relationship for system response time to tectonic perturbations, (3) determine the sensitivity of model behavior to various model parameters, and (4) integrate the above to suggest useful guidelines for further study of bedrock channel systems and for future refinement of the streampower erosion law. Dimensional analysis reveals that the dynamic behavior of the stream-power erosion model is governed by a single nondimensional group that we term the uplift-erosion number, greatly reducing the number of variables that need to be considered in the sensitivity analysis. The degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between stream incision rate and channel gradient (slope exponent n) emerges as a fundamental unknown. The physics of the active erosion processes directly influence this nonlinearity, which is shown to dictate the relationship between the uplift-erosion number, the equilibrium stream channel gradient, and the total fluvial relief of mountain ranges. Similarly, the predicted response time to changes in rock uplift rate is shown to depend on climate, rock strength, and the magnitude of tectonic perturbation, with the slope exponent n controlling the degree of dependence on these various factors. For typical drainage basin geometries the response time is relatively insensitive to the size of the system. Work on the physics of bedrock erosion processes, their sensitivity to extreme floods, their transient responses to sudden changes in climate or uplift rate, and the scaling of local rock erosion studies to reach-scale modeling studies are most sorely needed.},

	abstract = {Six national-scale, or near national-scale, geochemical data sets for soils or stream sediments exist for the United States. The earliest of these, here termed the ‘Shacklette’ data set, was generated by a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) project conducted from 1961 to 1975. This project used soil collected from a depth of about 20 cm as the sampling medium at 1323 sites throughout the conterminous U.S. The National Uranium Resource Evaluation Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance (NURE-HSSR) Program of the U.S. Department of Energy was conducted from 1975 to 1984 and collected either stream sediments, lake sediments, or soils at more than 378,000 sites in both the conterminous U.S. and Alaska. The sampled area represented about 65\% of the nation. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), from 1978 to 1982, collected samples from multiple soil horizons at sites within the major crop-growing regions of the conterminous U.S. This data set contains analyses of more than 3000 samples. The National Geochemical Survey, a USGS project conducted from 1997 to 2009, used a subset of the NURE-HSSR archival samples as its starting point and then collected primarily stream sediments, with occasional soils, in the parts of the U.S. not covered by the NURE-HSSR Program. This data set contains chemical analyses for more than 70,000 samples. The USGS, in collaboration with the Mexican Geological Survey and the Geological Survey of Canada, initiated soil sampling for the North American Soil Geochemical Landscapes Project in 2007. Sampling of three horizons or depths at more than 4800 sites in the U.S. was completed in 2010, and chemical analyses are currently ongoing. The NRCS initiated a project in the 1990s to analyze the various soil horizons from selected pedons throughout the U.S. This data set currently contains data from more than 1400 sites. This paper (1) discusses each data set in terms of its purpose, sample collection protocols, and analytical methods; and (2) evaluates each data set in terms of its appropriateness as a national-scale geochemical database and its usefulness for national-scale geochemical mapping.},

Multidimensional data of four sandstone data sets comprising major elements, log-normalized major elements, trace elements, and high field strength elements (HFSE) were projected into colored two-dimensional maps that can be visually and quantitatively interpreted. The cluster structure and variable distributions produced show that each sedimentary provenance group can be distinguished in the neural maps according to a unique combination of major or trace element concentrations. In these terms, the distinguishing features of each provenance group are: P1—high Fe2O3t, TiO2, MgO, MnO, CaO, P2O5, Sc, V, Cr, and Cu; P2—intermediate Fe2O3t, TiO2, MgO, MnO, CaO, Sc, V, and Cu; P3—intermediate to high K2O, intermediate SiO2 and Al2O3, low Fe2O3t and TiO2, and intermediate to low Nb, Rb, and Th; P4—high SiO2, Y, Nb, Rb, Th, Ba, and Zr, coupled with low Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, Fe2O3t, MgO, MnO, and TiO2.

	abstract = {A multilayer feed‐forward neural network, trained with a gradient descent, back‐propagation algorithm, is used to estimate the favourability for gold deposits using a raster GIS database for the Tenterfield 1:100 000 sheet area, New South Wales. The database consists of solid geology, regional faults, airborne magnetic and gamma‐ray survey data (U, Th, K and total count channels), and 63 deposit and occurrence locations. Input to the neural network consists of feature vectors formed by combining the values from co‐registered grid cells in each GIS thematic layer. The network was trained using binary target values to indicate the presence or absence of deposits. Although the neural network was trained as a binary classifier, output values for the trained network are in the range [0.1, 0.9] and are interpreted to indicate the degree of similarity of each input vector to a composite of all the deposit vectors used in training. These values are rescaled to produce a multiclass prospectivity map. To validate and assess the effectiveness of the neural‐network method, mineral‐prospectivity maps are also prepared using the empirical weights of evidence and the conceptual fuzzy‐logic methods. The neural‐network method produces a geologically plausible mineral‐prospectivity map similar, but superior, to the fuzzy logic and weights of evidence maps. The results of this study indicate that the use of neural networks for the integration of large multisource datasets used in regional mineral exploration, and for prediction of mineral prospectivity, offers several advantages over existing methods. These include the ability of neural networks to: (i) respond to critical combinations of parameters rather than increase the estimated prospectivity in response to each individual favourable parameter; (ii) combine datasets without the loss of information inherent in existing methods; and (iii) produce results that are relatively unaffected by redundant data, spurious data and data containing multiple populations. Statistical measures of map quality indicate that the neural‐network method performs as well as, or better than, existing methods while using approximately one‐third less data than the weights of evidence method.},

	abstract = {In actively deforming regions fluvial systems are strongly regulated by uplift. River geometries record histories of vertical motions that can be used to examine the driving forces generating topographic relief. Iceland's rapidly evolving landscapes provide an opportunity to disentangle histories of uplift generated by postglacial rebound, volcanism, dynamic support, and plate spreading. Broad knickzones observed along Iceland's large rivers, and its powerful waterfalls and deep canyons, hint that regional processes have generated significant relief. We combine high-resolution drone photogrammetry and cosmogenic 3He dating of fluvial terraces to measure the erosional history of one of Iceland's largest knickzones, Jökulsárglúfur, in the northeast part of the island. Progressive younging of terraces indicates knickpoint propagation rates of up to ∼70 cma−1 during the last 8 ka. Knickpoint velocities appear to be controlled partly by toppling of basalt columns. These rates were used to calibrate a model that inverts Iceland's drainage networks for uplift rate histories. Calculated uplift and isostatic calculations indicate that rifting, sub-plate support, and isostatic adjustment resulted in tens to hundreds of meters of regional Holocene uplift. Our results suggest regional uplift and fluvial erosion can rapidly generate hundreds of meters of relief in post-glacial landscapes.},

	abstract = {Sediment flux to the coastal zone is conditioned by geomorphic and tectonic influences (basin area and relief), geography (temperature, runoff), geology (lithology, ice cover), and human activities (reservoir trapping, soil erosion). A new model, termed “BQART” in recognition of those factors, accounts for these varied influences. When applied to a database of 488 rivers, the BQART model showed no ensemble over‐ or underprediction, had a bias of just 3\% across six orders of magnitude in observational values, and accounted for 96\% of the between‐river variation in the long‐term (±30 years) sediment load or yield of these rivers. The geographical range of the 488 rivers covers 63\% of the global land surface and is highly representative of global geology, climate, and socioeconomic conditions. Based strictly on geological parameters (basin area, relief, lithology, ice erosion), 65\% of the between‐river sediment load is explained. Climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) account for an additional 14\% of the variability in global patterns in load. Anthropogenic factors account for an additional 16\% of the between‐river loads, although with ever more dams being constructed or decommissioned and socioeconomic conditions and infrastructure in flux, this contribution is temporally variable. The glacial factor currently contributes only 1\% of the signal represented by our globally distributed database, but it would be much more important during and just after major glaciations. The BQART model makes possible the quantification of the influencing factors (e.g., climate, basin area, ice cover) within individual basins, to better interpret the terrestrial signal in marine sedimentary records. The BQART model predicts the long‐term flux of sediment delivered by rivers; it does not predict the episodicity (e.g., typhoons, earthquakes) of this delivery.},

	abstract = {The distribution of chemical elements at and near the Earth's surface, the so-called critical zone, is complex and reflects the geochemistry and mineralogy of the original substrate modified by environmental factors that include physical, chemical and biological processes over time. Geochemical data typically is illustrated in the form of plan view maps or vertical cross-sections, where the composition of regolith, soil, bedrock or any other material is represented. These are primarily point observations that frequently are interpolated to produce rasters of element distributions. Here we propose the application of environmental or covariate regression modelling to predict and better understand the controls on major and trace element geochemistry within the regolith. Available environmental covariate datasets (raster or vector) representing factors influencing regolith or soil composition are intersected with the geochemical point data in a spatial statistical correlation model to develop a system of multiple linear correlations. The spatial resolution of the environmental covariates, which typically is much finer (e.g. ∼90 m pixel) than that of geochemical surveys (e.g. 1 sample per 10-10,000 km2), carries over to the predictions. Therefore the derived predictive models of element concentrations take the form of continuous geochemical landscape representations that are potentially much more informative than geostatistical interpolations. Environmental correlation is applied to the Sir Samuel 1:250,000 scale map sheet in Western Australia to produce distribution models of individual elements describing the geochemical composition of the regolith and exposed bedrock. As an example we model the distribution of two elements – chromium and sodium. We show that the environmental correlation approach generates high resolution predictive maps that are statistically more accurate and effective than ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighting interpolation methods. Furthermore, insights can be gained into the landscape processes controlling element concentration, distribution and mobility from analysis of the covariates used in the model. This modelling approach can be extended to groups of elements (indices), element ratios, isotopes or mineralogy over a range of scales and in a variety of environments.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples.

Our modifications lead to models which set the new state of the art in class-conditional image synthesis.

	abstract = {The Ganga River is one of the main conveyors of sediments produced by Himalayan erosion. Determining the flux of elements transported through the system is essential to understand the dynamics of the basin. This is hampered by the chemical heterogeneity of sediments observed both in the water column and under variable hydrodynamic conditions. Using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) acquisitions with sediment depth profile sampling of the Ganga in Bangladesh we build a simple model to derive the annual flux and grain size distributions of the sediments. The model shows that ca. 390 (±30) Mt of sediments are transported on average each year through the Ganga at Haring Bridge (Bangladesh). Modeled average sediment grain size parameters D50 and D84 are 27 (±4) and 123 (±9) μm, respectively. Grain size parameters are used to infer average chemical compositions of the sediments owing to a strong grain size chemical composition relation. The integrated sediment flux is characterized by low Al/Si and Fe/Si ratios that are close to those inferred for the Himalayan crust. This implies that only limited sequestration occurs in the Gangetic floodplain. The stored sediment flux is estimated to c.a. 10\% of the initial Himalayan sediment flux by geochemical mass balance. The associated, globally averaged sedimentation rates in the floodplain are found to be ca. 0.08 mm/yr and yield average Himalayan erosion rate of ca. 0.9 mm/yr. This study stresses the need to carefully address the average composition of river sediments before solving large-scale geochemical budgets.},

	abstract = {The pursuit of high precision in geochemical analysis has no inherent limit. An appropriate analytical precision requirement can be set, however, by comparing the “analytical variance” with the other sources of variance in geochemical data. The purpose of a geochemical survey is to give a description of the geochemical variation of a region. Numerically this can be expressed in terms of the natural “geochemical variance” of the area. The information content is diminished by the two processes of measurement: the act of taking a sample adds a random error with “sampling variance”; and the act of chemical analysis adds another random error with “analytical variance”. In order to optimise the analytical variance for cost-effectiveness, rather than simply to minimize it, all three variances must be estimated. This requires that traditional analytical quality control be extended to include the total measurement process, rather than only the “analytical” portion. Such a Sampling and Analytical Quality Control Scheme (SAX) requires some duplication of field samples and the duplicate analysis of each field duplicate. A robust Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is then used to separate the three components of the total variance. Robust statistics can accommodate outlying values that have undue influence on classical ANOVA. For a clear description of the natural geochemical variance, the combined sampling and analytical variances for the data should comprise not more than, say, 20\% of the total variance. If this figure is exceeded then these extraneous variances should be reduced. The decision as to whether this reduction requires improved sampling or improved analytical precision can also be based on the ANOVA results. As a general rule, we suggest that the analytical variance should comprise not more than 4\% of the total variance. If, on the other hand, the analytical variance is less than 1\% of the total variance, then needless expense has probably been incurred and the natural geochemical variation can be adequately described with less precise methods of analysis. Similar arguments can be applied to sampling variance. An application of SAX with robust ANOVA to a stream sediment survey for Cu, Pb and Zn demonstrates the advantages of the technique. For the analytical geochemist it provides a realistic target for analytical precision. For the field geochemist it provides a quantitative tool for the design of geochemical surveys. It facilitates the optimisation of both sampling and chemical analysis for a particular region to reveal geochemical patterns at minimal expense.},

	abstract = {Depressions (or pits) are areas within a digital elevation model that are surrounded by higher terrain, with no outlet to lower areas. Filling them so they are level, as fluid would fill them if the terrain was impermeable, is often necessary in preprocessing DEMs. The depression-filling algorithm presented here – called Priority-Flood – unifies and improves the work of a number of previous authors who have published similar algorithms. The algorithm operates by flooding DEMs inwards from their edges using a priority queue to determine the next cell to be flooded. The resultant DEM has no depressions or digital dams: every cell is guaranteed to drain. The algorithm is optimal for both integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(nlog2n) time, respectively. It is shown that by using a plain queue to fill depressions once they have been found, an O(mlog2m) time-complexity can be achieved, where m does not exceed the number of cells n. This is the lowest time complexity of any known floating-point depression-filling algorithm. In testing, this improved variation of the algorithm performed up to 37\% faster than the original. Additionally, a parallel version of an older, but widely used, depression-filling algorithm required six parallel processors to achieve a run-time on par with what the newer algorithm's improved variation took on a single processor. The Priority-Flood Algorithm is simple to understand and implement: the included pseudocode is only 20 lines and the included C++ reference implementation is under a hundred lines. The algorithm can work on irregular meshes as well as 4-, 6-, 8-, and n-connected grids. It can also be adapted to label watersheds and determine flow directions through either incremental elevation changes or depression carving. In the case of incremental elevation changes, the algorithm includes safety checks not present in prior works.},

	url = {https://osf.io/yab5d},
	abstract = {The volcanism of the Eifel volcanic field (EVF), in west-central Germany, is often considered an example of hotspot volcanism given its geochemical signature and the putative mantle plume imaged underneath. EVF’s setting in a stable continental area provides a rare natural laboratory to image surface deformation and test the hypothesis of there being a thermally buoyant plume. Here we use Global Positioning System (GPS) data to robustly image vertical land motion (VLM) and horizontal strain rates over most of intraplate Europe. We find a spatially-coherent positive VLM anomaly over an area much larger than the EVF and with a maximum uplift of {\textasciitilde}1 mm yr−1 at the EVF (when corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment). This rate is considerably higher than averaged over the Late-Quaternary. Over the same area that uplifts, we find significant horizontal extension surrounded by a radial pattern of shortening, a superposition that strongly suggests a common dynamic cause. Besides the Eifel, no other area in NW Europe shows significant positive VLM coupled with extensional strain rates, except for the much broader region of glacial isostatic adjustment. We refer to this 3D deformation anomaly as the Eifel Anomaly. We also find an extensional strain rate anomaly near the Massif Central volcanic field surrounded by radial shortening, but we do not detect a significant positive VLM signal there. The fact that the Eifel Anomaly is located above the Eifel plume suggests the plume causes the anomaly. Indeed, we show that buoyancy forces induced by the plume at the bottom of the lithosphere can explain this remarkable surface deformation. Plume-induced deformation can also explain the relatively high rate of regional seismicity, particularly along the Lower Rhine Embayment.},

	abstract = {The nature of the rocks exposed to weathering and erosion on continents exerts an important control on weathering feedbacks and the supply of nutrients to the oceans. It also reflects the prevailing tectonic regime responsible for the formation of continents. How the chemical and lithological compositions of the continents evolved through time is, however, still a matter of debate. We use an extensive compilation of terrigenous sediment compositions to better constrain the nature of rocks at the surface of continents at 3.25 Gyr and 250 Myr ago. Specifically, we use geochemical ratios that are sensitive indicators of komatiite, mafic, and felsic rocks in the provenance of the sediments. Our results show that the average Al2O3/TiO2 ratio of fine-grained terrigenous sediments decreased slightly over time from 26.2 ± 1.3 in the Archean to 22.1 ± 1.1 (2SE) in the Phanerozoic. In contrast, in the same time interval, the average Zr/TiO2 ratio stayed nearly constant at ∼245. Considering the distinct behaviors of Al, Ti and Zr during sedimentary processes, we find that hydrodynamic mineral sorting had a minor effect on the chemical composition of Archean fine-grained sediments, but could have been more effective during periods of supercontinents. We show that the compositions of Phanerozoic sediments (Al2O3/TiO2, Zr/TiO2, La/Sc, Th/Sc, Ni/Co, Cr/Sc) are best explained with igneous rocks at the surface of continents consisting of 76 ± 8 wt\% felsic, 14 ± 6 wt\% Arc-basalts and 10 ± 2 wt\% within-plate basalts, most likely in the form of continental flood basalts. Applying the same mass-balance calculations to the Paleoarchean suggests continental landmasses with 65 ± 7 wt\% felsic, 25 ± 6 wt\% mafic and 11 ± 3 wt\% ultramafic rocks (all 2SE), likely in the form of komatiites. The presence of volumetrically abundant felsic rocks at the surface of continents (as evident from the sediment record) as well as at mid-crustal levels (as evident from presently exposed igneous rock record) in Paleoarchean cratons is currently best explained with the onset of subduction magmatism before 3.25 Gyr.},

Archean UCC, dominated by greenstone basalts and to a lesser extent komatiites, was more mafic, based on major elements and transition metal trace elements. Temporal changes in oxygen isotope ratios, rare earth elements, and high field strength elements indicate that the UCC became more differentiated and that tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite suites became less important with time, findings consistent with previous studies. We also document the concentrations of siderophile and chalcophile elements (Ga, Ge, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, W, Tl, Bi) and lithophile Be in the UCC through time, and use the data for the younger diamictites to construct a new estimate of average UCC along with associated uncertainties.},

The ghost of continental crust long eroded away may exist in certain element ratios found in Archean rocks. Tang et al. used Ni/Co and Cr/Zn ratios as a proxy for the magnesium oxide that long ago weathered away in Earth's oldest rocks. This allowed a reconstruction of rock composition, which appears to be very different from that of the crust today. The shift to contemporary crust composition occurred after the Archean era, suggesting the onset of plate tectonics.
Science, this issue p. 372
The Archean Eon witnessed the production of early continental crust, the emergence of life, and fundamental changes to the atmosphere. The nature of the first continental crust, which was the interface between the surface and deep Earth, has been obscured by the weathering, erosion, and tectonism that followed its formation. We used Ni/Co and Cr/Zn ratios in Archean terrigenous sedimentary rocks and Archean igneous/metaigneous rocks to track the bulk MgO composition of the Archean upper continental crust. This crust evolved from a highly mafic bulk composition before 3.0 billion years ago to a felsic bulk composition by 2.5 billion years ago. This compositional change was attended by a fivefold increase in the mass of the upper continental crust due to addition of granitic rocks, suggesting the onset of global plate tectonics at {\textasciitilde}3.0 billion years ago.

	abstract = {The generation and evolution of continental topography are fundamental geologic and geomorphic concerns. In particular, the history of landscape development might contain useful information about the spatiotemporal evolution of deep Earth processes, such as mantle convection. A significant challenge is to generate observations and theoretical predictions of sufficient fidelity to enable landscape evolution to be constrained at scales of interest. Here, we combine substantial inventories of stratigraphic and geomorphic observations with inverse and forward modeling approaches to determine how the North American landscape evolved. First, stratigraphic markers are used to estimate postdepositional regional uplift. Present-day elevations of these deposits demonstrate that {\textgreater}2 km of long-wavelength surface uplift centered on the Colorado-Rocky-Mountain plateaus occurred in Cenozoic times. Second, to bridge the gaps between these measurements, an inverse modeling scheme is used to calculate the smoothest spatiotemporal pattern of rock uplift rate that yields the smallest misfit between 4,161 observed and calculated longitudinal river profiles. Our results suggest that Cenozoic regional uplift occurred in a series of stages, in agreement with independent stratigraphic observations. Finally, a landscape evolution model driven by this calculated rock uplift history is used to determine drainage patterns, denudation, and sedimentary flux from Late Cretaceous times until the present day. These patterns are broadly consistent with stratigraphic and thermochronologic observations. We conclude that a calibrated inverse modeling strategy can be used to reliably extract the temporal and spatial evolution of the North American landscape at geodynamically useful scales.},

	abstract = {The study of a sample of river sediment enables the determination of spatially averaged denudation rates that provide an exceptional perspective on erosion and weathering processes that have taken place within a landscape. These measurements are done with in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides (e.g. 10Be, 26Al), mostly in quartz from alluvial sediment. Cosmogenic nuclides are produced when secondary cosmic rays interact with the very uppermost layer of the Earth's surface. They are produced within a characteristic depth scale of about 1 m, which means that the measured concentrations record an integrated denudation history while material passed through this depth interval. Depending on the denudation rate the resulting integration time scales are 103 to 105 years, and one obtains a robust long-term estimate of natural denudation that is relatively insensitive to short-term changes. The last 10 years have seen significant research activity using these methods, and an array of fascinating tectono-geomorphologic and geochemical insights are emerging. Amongst these is the ability to identify the physical and chemical processes with which a landscape responds to tectonic activity or climate change. A compilation of world-wide denudation rates in non-glaciated areas, that however, does not yet include some of the world's most active mountain belts, has resulted in the following findings, some of which have been unexpected: (1) No obvious relationship between precipitation or mean annual temperature and total denudation is apparent. (2) Topographic relief alone does not result in high rates of denudation. (3) Denudation rates are high in areas of landscape rejuvenation; that is triggered and controlled by tectonic activity (faulting, escarpment formation and retreat, rifting, surface uplift). (4) Rates of weathering (using a combination of cosmogenic nuclides and zirconium-normalised cation loss balances) co-vary primarily with physical erosion rates and much less with temperature or precipitation. (5) In some areas of high land use short-term rates (from river load gauging) exceed those from cosmogenic nuclides by several orders of magnitude, which serves to highlight the severity of geomorphic change caused by human action. In the future, the control mechanisms over denudation will be determined on all spatial scales, ranging from the single soil section to entire river basins. The same analysis can be done back through time on well-dated terraces, lake records, and marine sediment cores, which is possible with 10Be for the past 1–2 My. The rates obtained will be used to develop a quantitative understanding of tectonic, geomorphologic, and geochemical landscape processes, which in turn is a prerequisite to design and calibrate models of the response of landscapes to tectonic, climate, and anthropogenic forcing.},

	abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We ﬁrst observe the inﬂuence of the non-linear activations functions. We ﬁnd that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We ﬁnd that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneﬁcial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difﬁcult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

	abstract = {The correct use of model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection techniques is vital in academic machine learning research as well as in many industrial settings. This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-one-out cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally, alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as the combined F-test 5x2 cross-validation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine learning algorithms when datasets are small.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overﬁtting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it diﬃcult to deal with overﬁtting by combining the predictions of many diﬀerent large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of diﬀerent “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the eﬀect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This signiﬁcantly reduces overﬁtting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classiﬁcation and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

In this paper we define confidence intervals for multivariate data that extend the one-dimensional definition in a natural way. In our definition every variable is associated with its own confidence interval as usual, but a data vector can be outside of a few of these, and still be considered to be within the confidence area. We analyze the problem and show that the resulting confidence areas retain the good qualities of their one-dimensional counterparts: they are informative and easy to interpret. Furthermore, we show that the problem of finding multivariate confidence intervals is hard, but provide efficient approximate algorithms to solve the problem.},

	abstract = {New Sm-Nd, Lu-Hf, Hf-W, and Re-Os isotope data, in combination with highly siderophile element (HSE, including Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd) and W abundances, are reported for the 3.55 Ga Schapenburg komatiites, South Africa. The Schapenburg komatiites define a Re-Os isochron with an age of 3550 ± 87 Ma and initial γ187Os = +3.7 ± 0.2 (2SD). The absolute HSE abundances in the mantle source of the Schapenburg komatiite system are estimated to be only 29 ± 5\% of those in the present-day bulk silicate Earth (BSE). The komatiites were derived from mantle enriched in the decay products of the long-lived 147Sm and 176Lu nuclides (initial ɛ143Nd = +2.4 ± 0.1, ɛ176Hf = +5.7 ± 0.3, 2SD). By contrast, the komatiites are depleted, relative to the modern mantle, in 142Nd and 182W (μ182W = −8.4 ± 4.5, μ142Nd = −4.9 ± 2.8, 2SD). These results constitute the first observation in terrestrial rocks of coupled depletions in 142Nd and 182W. Such isotopic depletions require derivation of the komatiites from a mantle domain that formed within the first ∼30 Ma of Solar System history and was initially geochemically enriched in highly incompatible trace elements as a result of crystal-liquid fractionation in an early magma ocean. This mantle domain further must have experienced subsequent melt depletion, after 182Hf had gone extinct, to account for the observed initial excesses in 143Nd and 176Hf. The survival of early-formed 182W and 142Nd anomalies in the mantle until at least 3.55 Ga indicates that the products of early planetary differentiation survived both later planetary accretion and convective mantle mixing during the Hadean. This work moreover renders unlikely that variable late accretion, by itself, can account for all of the observed W isotope variations in Archean rocks.},

This paper describes the pristine Palaeoproterozoic Winnipegosis Komatiites, from Manitoba, Canada, which form part of the Circum-Superior Belt large igneous province. We present a comprehensive petrographical investigation, mineral and bulk rock geochemistry, and Al-in-olivine thermometry for the Winnipegosis Komatiites, along with new U-Pb SHRIMP dating of zircons from a mafic unit, which yield an age of 1870.3±7.1Ma for the Winnipegosis Komatiite Belt. The komatiites are Al-undepleted and dominated by massive olivine porphyritic flows with a median thickness of 6m. Differentiated flows containing layers of olivine spinifex are present, but rare. Trace element data indicate the komatiites were derived from depleted mantle, and subsequently contaminated with 2–3\% continental crust. Temperatures from Al-in-olivine thermometry are consistent with a nominally dry melt, and combined with olivine-melt Mg–Fe partitioning, suggest a parental melt with {\textasciitilde}24wt\% MgO and a liquidus (olivine) temperature of {\textasciitilde}1501°C, approximately 100°C cooler than their hottest Archaean counterparts. At {\textasciitilde}1424°C chromite joined olivine as a crystallising phase. Olivine and chromite phenocrysts were re-mixed with residual melt shortly before or during komatiite eruption, which occurred by the time the magma had cooled to {\textasciitilde}1321°C. Combined geochemical and geological evidence requires that the Winnipegosis Komatiites erupted onto rifting continental crust. Their high liquidus temperatures require anomalously hot mantle. Considering the Winnipegosis Komatiites in the context of the broader Circum-Superior Belt, we suggest that these magmas formed from a mantle plume that was deflected towards the margins of the Superior craton by strong gradients in lithospheric thickness. This interpretation of the mode of formation of the Circum-Superior Belt casts doubt on ambient mantle potential temperatures as high as 1600°C during the Proterozoic.},

	abstract = {We present field, petrographic, Sm–Nd whole-rock isochron and whole-rock geochemical data for komatiites from Sargur Group greenstone belts of the western Dharwar craton. Field evidence such as pillow structure indicates their eruption in a marine environment. Petrographic data reveal that the igneous mineralogy has been altered during post-magmatic hydrothermal alteration processes corresponding to greenschist- to lower amphibolite facies conditions with rarely preserved primary olivine and orthopyroxene. A 16-point Sm–Nd whole-rock isochron gives an age of 3352±110Ma for the timing of eruption of komatiite lavas. About 60\% of the studied komatiite samples show Al-depletion whilst the remaining are Al-undepleted. The Al-depleted komatiites are characterised by high CaO/Al2O3 ratios (1.01–1.34) and low Al2O3/TiO2 (5–16) whereas Al-undepleted komatiites show lower CaO/Al2O3 ratios (0.59–0.99) and higher Al2O3/TiO2 (17–26). Trace element distribution patterns of komatiites suggest that most of the primary geochemical and Nd isotopic compositions are preserved with only minor influence of post-magmatic alteration processes and negligible crustal contamination. The chemical characteristics of Al-depleted komatiites, such as high (Gd/Yb)N together with lower HREE, Y, Zr and Hf, imply their derivation from deeper upper mantle with garnet (majorite?) involvement, whereas lower (Gd/Yb)N slightly higher HREE, Y, Zr and Hf suggest derivation from shallower upper mantle without garnet involvement. The observed chemical characteristics (CaO/Al2O3, Al2O3/TiO2, MgO, Ni, Cr, Nb, Zr, Y, Hf, REE) indicate derivation of the komatiite magmas from different depths in a plume setting, whereas sub-contemporaneous felsic volcanism and TTG accretion can be attributed to an arc setting. In order to explain the spatial association of komatiite volcanism with contemporaneous mafic-felsic volcanism and TTG accretion we propose a combined plume-arc setting. Nd isotope data of the studied komatiites indicate depleted mantle reservoirs which may have evolved by early ({\textgreater}4.53Ga) global differentiation of the silicate Earth as suggested by Boyet and Carlson [Boyet, M., Carlson, R.W., 2005. 142Nd evidence for early ({\textgreater}4.53Ga) global differentiation of silicate Earth.

Twenty six of the 27 units studied show elevated chemical index of alternation (CIA) and low Sr abundances, regardless of their age, documenting pervasive weathering of the average UCC. Lower abundances of transition metals reﬂect a shift towards more felsic crustal compositions after the Archean. Superimposed on this chemical difference is the signal of the rise of oxidative weathering of the continents, recorded by changes in the absolute and relative abundances of the redox sensitive elements Mo and V. Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic diamictites show pervasive depletion in Mo and V, reﬂecting their loss from the continents due to increasing intensity of oxidative weathering, as also recorded in some of the Paleoproterozoic diamictites. A few of the Paleoproterozoic diamictites deposited after the Great Oxidation Event show no depletion in Mo and V (e.g., Gowganda), but such signatures could be inherited from their provenance. In contrast, the pre-GOE Duitschland diamictite (ca. 2.3–2.5 Ga) from South Africa reveals evidence of intense oxidative weathering (i.e., large depletions in Mo), supporting a growing body of observations showing the presence of measurable atmospheric oxygen prior to permanent loss of the mass independent fractionation signal in sulfur isotopes.},

The study is then extended to a real geochemical data set, where the practical value of isometric logratios is further investigated. When groups of parts are required in practical applications, preferably based on substantive knowledge, it is demonstrated that logratios of amalgamations serve as a simpler, more intuitive and more interpretable alternative to isometric logratios. A reduced set of simple logratios of pairs of parts, possibly involving prescribed amalgamations, is adequate in accounting for the variance in a compositional data set, and highlights which parts are driving the data structure.},

Near Crater Lake caldera, monogenetic lava compositions include: lowK (as low as O09\% K2O) high-alumina olivine tholeiite (HAOT); medium-K. calc-alkaline basalt, basaltic andesite, and andesite; and shoshonitic basaltic andesite ( 2 1 \% K2O, 1750 ppm Sr at 54\% SiO2). Tholeiites have MORB-like trace element abundances except for elevated Sr, Ba, and Th and low high field strength elements (HFSE), and they represent near-primary liquids. They arc similar to HAOTs from the Cascades and adjacent Basin and Range, and to many primitive basalts from intraoceanic arcs. Calc-alkaline lavas show a well-developed arc signature of high large-ion lithophile elements (LILE) and low HFSE. Their Zr and Hf concentrations are at least partly decoupled from those of Nb and Ta; HREE are low relative to HAOT. Incompatible element abundances and ratios vary widely among basaltic andesites. Some calc-alkaline lavas vented near Mount Mazama contain abundant gabbroic microxcnoliths, and are basaltic andesitic magmas contaminated with olivine gabbro.},

	abstract = {Models for when and how the continental crust was formed are constrained by estimates in the rates of crustal growth. The record of events preserved in the continental crust is heterogeneous in time with distinctive peaks and troughs of ages for igneous crystallisation, metamorphism, continental margins and mineralisation. For the most part these are global signatures, and the peaks of ages tend to be associated with periods of increased reworking of pre-existing crust, reflected in the Hf isotope ratios of zircons and their elevated oxygen isotope ratios. Increased crustal reworking is attributed to periods of crustal thickening associated with compressional tectonics and the development of supercontinents. Magma types similar to those from recent within-plate and subduction related settings appear to have been generated in different areas at broadly similar times before ∼3.0 Ga. It can be difficult to put the results of such detailed case studies into a more global context, but one approach is to consider when plate tectonics became the dominant mechanism involved in the generation of juvenile continental crust. The development of crustal growth models for the continental crust are discussed, and a number of models based on different data sets indicate that 65\%–70\% of the present volume of the continental crust was generated by 3 Ga. Such estimates may represent minimum values, but since ∼3 Ga there has been a reduction in the rates of growth of the continental crust. This reduction is linked to an increase in the rates at which continental crust is recycled back into the mantle, and not to a reduction in the rates at which continental crust was generated. Plate tectonics results in both the generation of new crust and its destruction along destructive plate margins. Thus, the reduction in the rate of continental crustal growth at ∼3 Ga is taken to reflect the period in which plate tectonics became the dominant mechanism by which new continental crust was generated.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the average composition of the upper continental crust is crucial to establish not only how it formed but also when. While well constrained averages have been suggested for its major and trace element composition, no values exist for its Nd and Hf isotopic compositions even though radiogenic isotopic systems provide valuable information on its average model age. Here we present Nd and Hf isotopic data determined on a large number of loess deposits from several continents. We demonstrate that these deposits have very uniform Nd and Hf isotopic compositions. We obtain an average Nd isotopic composition that is similar to previous estimates for the upper continental crust (εNd=−10.3±1.2 (1σ)) and we establish a new Hf average value at εHf=−13.2±2 (1σ). This average falls on the “Terrestrial Array”, demonstrating that the two parent–daughter ratios are not decoupled during crust formation. Trace element data acquired on the same set of samples allow us to calculate an average 147Sm/144Nd ratio for the upper continental crust: 0.1193±0.0026, a value slightly higher than previous estimates. Based on the relationship between Sm/Nd and Nd isotopes, we estimate the average Nd extraction age of upper continental crust from the depleted mantle at TDM(Nd)=1.82±0.07 Ga. This model age is entirely consistent with previous suggestions made for example by Goldstein et al. (1984). Assuming that for each individual sample, the Hf model age cannot be younger than the Nd model age, our new Nd–Hf isotopic data provide a value for the very poorly known 176Lu/177Hf ratio of the upper crust. Our estimate is 176Lu/177Hf = 0.0125 ± 0.0018, a value significantly lower than commonly used values (0.0150–0.0159; Griffin et al., 2002, Goodge and Vervoort, 2006, Hawkesworth et al., 2010) but higher than Rudnick and Gaoʼs (2003) estimate of 0.0083. The impact of our new 176Lu/177Hf ratio on crustal model ages of zircon populations is not simple to evaluate but the Hf model ages calculated with this new Lu/Hf ratio could be younger by up to 500 Ma.},

One important implication of such a model is that the geological record becomes progressively less voluminous and less complete with increasing age. Here we show that the predictions of a model in which the destruction of sedimentary rock is the predominant process signal are borne out only among sediments deposited on oceanic crust and among sediments deposited above sea level in non-marine environments. Most of the surviving volume of sedimentary rock ({\textasciitilde}75\%) was deposited in and adjacent to shallow seas on continental crust and does not exhibit any steady decrease in quantity with increasing age. Instead, shallow marine sediments exhibit large ﬂuctuations in quantity that were driven by shifting global tectonic boundary conditions, such as those that occur during the breakup and coalescence of supercontinents. The accumulation of sediments on the continents has not been uniform in rate, but it does record a primary signal of net growth that has many implications for the long-term evolution of Earth’s surface environment.},

	abstract = {Tectonic plate velocities predominantly result from a balance between the potential energy change of the subducting slab and viscous dissipation in the mantle, bending lithosphere, and slab–upper plate interface. A range of observations suggest that slabs may be weak, implying a more prominent role for plate interface dissipation than previously thought. The shallow thrust interface is commonly assumed to be weak due to an abundance of fluids and near-lithostatic pore fluid pressures, but little attention has been paid to the influence of the deeper, viscous interface. Here we show that the deep interface viscosity in subduction zones is strongly affected by the relative proportions of sedimentary to mafic rocks that are subducted to depth. Where sediments on the down-going plate are sparse, the deep interface is dominated by mafic lithologies that metamorphose to eclogites, which exhibit viscosities 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the asthenospheric mantle, and reduce subduction plate speeds. In contrast, where sediments are abundant and subducted to depth, the deep interface viscosity is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than the asthenospheric mantle, thus allowing significantly faster plate velocities. This correlation between subduction plate speed and deep sediment subduction may help explain dramatic accelerations (or decelerations) in convergence rates, such as the acceleration documented for India–Asia convergence during the mid-Cenozoic.},

In addition to the 14 large plates whose motion was described by the NUVEL-1A poles (Africa, Antarctica, Arabia, Australia, Caribbean, Cocos, Eurasia, India, Juan de Fuca, Nazca, North America, Pacific, Philippine Sea, South America), model PB2002 includes 38 small plates (Okhotsk, Amur, Yangtze, Okinawa, Sunda, Burma, Molucca Sea, Banda Sea, Timor, Birds Head, Maoke, Caroline, Mariana, North Bismarck, Manus, South Bismarck, Solomon Sea, Woodlark, New Hebrides, Conway Reef, Balmoral Reef, Futuna, Niuafo'ou, Tonga, Kermadec, Rivera, Galapagos, Easter, Juan Fernandez, Panama, North Andes, Altiplano, Shetland, Scotia, Sandwich, Aegean Sea, Anatolia, Somalia), for a total of 52 plates. No attempt is made to divide the Alps-Persia-Tibet mountain belt, the Philippine Islands, the Peruvian Andes, the Sierras Pampeanas, or the California-Nevada zone of dextral transtension into plates; instead, they are designated as “orogens” in which this plate model is not expected to be accurate. The cumulative-number/area distribution for this model follows a power law for plates with areas between 0.002 and 1 steradian. Departure from this scaling at the small-plate end suggests that future work is very likely to define more very small plates within the orogens. The model is presented in four digital files: a set of plate boundary segments; a set of plate outlines; a set of outlines of the orogens; and a table of characteristics of each digitization step along plate boundaries, including estimated relative velocity vector and classification into one of 7 types (continental convergence zone, continental transform fault, continental rift, oceanic spreading ridge, oceanic transform fault, oceanic convergent boundary, subduction zone). Total length, mean velocity, and total rate of area production/destruction are computed for each class; the global rate of area production and destruction is 0.108 m2/s, which is higher than in previous models because of the incorporation of back-arc spreading.},

	abstract = {Relations characterizing the chemical, physical, and mechanical changes resulting from metasomatic hydrochemical processes are developed using mass balance models which formally link chemical composition to bulk density, mineral density, volumetric properties, porosity, and amount of deformation (strain). Rigorous analysis of aqueous solute transport effects is then made possible in a variety of porous media flow environments including chemical weathering, pedogenesis (soil formation), diagenesis, ore deposition and enrichment, and metamorphism. Application of these linear constitutive relations to chemical weathering profiles shows that immobile and locally mobile chemical elements, with masses conserved on the scale of soil profiles, can be accurately identified from analysis of appropriate data arrays and then used as natural geochemical tracers to infer the nature and extent of hydrochemical weathering processes and volume changes during pedogenesis. Assumptions commonly made in the past about the supposed immobility of certain elements, e.g., Ti and Zr, become unnecessary. Quantitative differentiation between the effects of residual and supergene fractionation is then easily made. These methods are applied to Ni-rich laterites developed by weathering of ultramafic rocks, showing that during ordinary residual enrichment, Ni is concentrated by as much as 4× protolith peridotite concentrations. This occurs simply by silicate mineral dissolution and removal of chemical elements other than Ni (e.g., Mg) with a corresponding reduction in saprolite density and increase in bulk porosity without significant deformation. In contrast, laterites with mineable concentrations of Ni which are similarly undeformed (such as the Nickel Mountain Mine in Riddle, Oregon) have experienced, in addition to residual enrichment, strong supergene enrichment by fractionation of ore elements between a leached zone from which Ni is extracted and a complementary enriched zone positioned farther along the direction of ground water flow. Soil-forming processes in podzol chronosequences developed on sandy beach terraces of the Mendocino Coast of California involved soil column collapse of 60 percent by dissolution of silicate minerals in the albic horizon of Al and Fe leaching, and 70 percent dilation (expansion) in the overlying organic-rich layer by root growth. The amount of erosion based upon paleosurface reconstructions using the excess mass of Fe, Al, Pb, Ga, and Cu in the zone of supergene enrichment (spodic horizon) below the ground water table indicates that subsurface erosion by dissolutional collapse is three times that of surficial erosion. Finally, using published chemical data for Ti, Zr, and Cr on major bauxite deposits in Australia where erosion rates are thought to be low, we infer that there may have been major amounts of dissolutional collapse to explain the upwards increase of detrital zircon and rutile in weathering profiles.},

Conglomerate, sandstone, and shale data give somewhat differing pictures of provenance and weathering due to derivation from different components within the source terrane and size and compositional fractionation during transport. The results suggest that shale geochemistry provides the most accurate estimate provenance, although both rare-earth element and trace element (Th, Sc, Zr, Cr, and Ti) data must be used in combination to give the best results. The source area for Moodies Group sediments was dominated by tonalite, felsic volcanic rock, komatiite-basalt, and granite. Based on mineralogical and major-element divergence from estimated source area composition, the Moodies Group sediments are remnants of an aggressive weathering environment. Labile materials, such as komatiite, basalt, and coarse plagioclase grains, decomposed almost entirely to clays and solutes, and the chemical index of alteration for Moodies shale is well above the global average. An aggressive weathering environment in the Archean may have been achieved by increased rainfall, higher temperatures, and/or higher atmospheric PCO2. More likely, a combination of these conditions worked to offset the inhibitory weathering effects of a plant-free environment.},

Zeederbergs shale is characterized by high contents of MgO and transition metals and low concentrations of K2O and LILE as compared to average Phanerozoic shale, indicative of an ultramafic to mafic source terrain. Cheshire shales have similar major and trace element contents, but MgO and transition metals are less enriched and the LILE are less depleted. Zeederbergs shales have smoothly fractionated REE patterns (LaN/YbN = 2.84–4.45) and no significant Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* = 0.93–0.96). REE patterns are identical to those of the surrounding basaltic rocks, indicating local derivation from submarine reworking. Cheshire shales have rather flat REE patterns (LaN/YbN = 0.69–2.19) and a small, negative Eu anomaly (average Eu/Eu* = 0.85), indicative of a mafic provenance with minor contributions of felsic detritus. A systematic change in REE patterns and concentrations of transition metals and HFSE upwards in the sedimentary succession indicates erosion of progressively more LREE-depleted basalts and ultramafic volcanic rocks, followed by unroofing of granitoid crust. Weathering indices confirm the submarine nature of Zeederbergs shale, whereas Cheshire shale was derived from a source terrain subjected to intense chemical weathering.},

Mineralogical and geochemical data from a continuous stratigraphic record of Lower and Upper Shale members of the Soltanieh Formation are used to define their provenance, tectonic setting as well as geochemical variations during the PC–C transition. The Soltanieh mudrocks are composed of quartz and plagioclase, with minor constituents of illite, chlorite and montmorillonite. The chemical index of alteration, A-CN-K (Al2O3 – CaO + Na2O – K2O) relations, index of compositional variability, and Th/Sc versus Zr/Sc ratios indicate low chemical weathering in source areas, compositionally immature and first-cycle sediments. Immobile trace-element ratios and discrimination diagrams, chondrite-normalized rare Earth element (REE) patterns and negative Eu anomaly, along with low total REE abundances and negligible Ce anomalies, demonstrate that the Soltanieh Formation was mainly derived from proximal felsic-intermediate Cadomian magmatic arc sources and deposited in a continental-arc-related basin on the proto-Tethyan active margin of Gondwana. The palaeoredox indicators exhibit a remarkable change in environmental condition from a suboxic to an oxic state across the PC–C transition from the Kahar Formation to the Upper Shale Member of the Soltanieh Formation. Moreover, a significant upwards increase of P, Ba, and Ca is likely associated with enhanced fluxes of nutrient elements during the PC–C transition, coeval with the building of collisional mountain belts during the amalgamation of Gondwana.},

	abstract = {We present GlobSed, a new global 5-arc-minute total sediment thickness grid for the world's oceans and marginal seas. GlobSed covers a larger area than previously published global grids and incorporates updates for the NE Atlantic, Arctic, Southern Ocean, and Mediterranean regions, which results in a 29.7\% increase in estimated total oceanic sediment volume. We use this new global grid and a revised global oceanic lithospheric age grid to assess the relationship between the total sediment thickness and age of the underlying oceanic lithosphere and its latitude. An analytical approximation model is used to mathematically describe sedimentation trends in major oceanic basins and to allow paleobathymetric reconstructions at any given geological time. This study provides a much-needed update of the sediment thickness distribution of the world oceans and delivers a model for sedimentation rates on oceanic crust through time that agrees well with selected drill data used for comparison.},

	abstract = {Fine-grained ellipsoidal inclusions from a few millimeters to over l m in size are present in many intermediate to silicic lava flows and domes. Only recently has it become widely accepted that such inclusions are chilled blobs of magma. Their magmatic origin is manifested by vesicularity and high groundmass porosity, by ellipsoidal shapes, by mingling at contacts with the host, and by textural evidence for groundmass crystallization in an undercooled state. Groundmass textures reflect the degree of undercooling, which is a function of thermal contrast (ΔT) between inclusions and host magmas before mingling. Compositions of inclusions are invariably more mafic than their hosts and indicate that the magmatic systems were compositionally zoned. Many inclusions were formed from hybrid magmas. Four examples are given in order to document effects of decreasing ΔC (compositional contrast) and ΔT, as hosts for mafic andesitic to andesitic inclusions vary from high-silica rhyolite (HSR) to silicic andesite. In the HSR example from the Coso volcanic field, California, inclusions track the evolution of zonation in a long-lived magmatic system. At the other extreme, andesitic inclusions in silicic andesite from Crater Lake, Oregon, demonstrate zonation of a system of low ΔT and ΔC and show effects of in situ differentiation by gas filter-pressing of residual liquid. Inclusions form when a relatively small proportion of mafic magma comes into contact with a larger proportion of silicic magma. Several mechanisms by which the magmas mix have been proposed: buoyant rise of vesiculated mafic magma or convective stirring at the interface between mafic and overlying silicic magma, forcible injection of mafic magma, diking of fractured silicic magma, and mixing during ascent in a conduit. No single mechanism explains all field observations. Many inclusions in plutons are analogous to magmatic inclusions in volcanic rocks but are likely to have suffered greater chemical and textural change during comparatively slow postentrapment cooling. Magmatic inclusions are evidence of open system behavior of the differentiated parts of magma bodies, and the inclusions themselves may behave as open systems where ΔT is low.},

	abstract = {The well-documented eruptive history of Mount Mazama, Oregon, provides an excellent opportunity to use pre-eruptive volatile concentrations to study the growth of an explosive silicic magmatic system. Melt inclusions (MI) hosted in pyroxene and plagioclase crystals from eight dacitic–rhyodacitic eruptive deposits (71–7.7 ka) were analyzed to determine variations in volatile-element concentrations and changes in magma storage conditions leading up to and including the climactic eruption of Crater Lake caldera. Temperatures (Fe–Ti oxides) increased through the series of dacites, then decreased, and increased again through the rhyodacites (918–968 to {\textasciitilde}950 to 845–895 °C). Oxygen fugacity began at nickel–nickel-oxide buffer (NNO) +0.8 (71 ka), dropped slightly to NNO +0.3, and then climbed to its highest value with the climactic eruption (7.7 ka) at NNO +1.1 log units. In parallel with oxidation state, maximum MI sulfur concentrations were high early in the eruptive sequence ({\textasciitilde}500 ppm), decreased (to {\textasciitilde}200 ppm), and then increased again with the climactic eruption ({\textasciitilde}500 ppm). Maximum MI sulfur correlates with the Sr content (as a proxy for LREE, Ba, Rb, P2O5) of recharge magmas, represented by basaltic andesitic to andesitic enclaves and similar-aged lavas. These results suggest that oxidized Sr-rich recharge magmas dominated early and late in the development of the pre-climactic dacite–rhyodacite system. Dissolved H2O concentrations in MI do not, however, correlate with these changes in dominant recharge magma, instead recording vapor solubility relations in the developing shallow magma storage and conduit region. Dissolved H2O concentrations form two populations through time: the first at 3–4.6 wt\% (with a few extreme values up to 6.1 wt\%) and the second at ≤2.4 wt\%. CO2 concentrations measured in a subset of these inclusions reach up to 240 ppm in early-erupted deposits (71 ka) and are below detection in climactic deposits (7.7 ka). Combined H2O and CO2 concentrations and solubility models indicate a dominant storage region at 4–7 km (up to 12 km), with drier inclusions that diffusively re-equilibrated and/or were trapped at shallower depths. Boron and Cl (except in the climactic deposit) largely remained in the melt, suggesting vapor–melt partition coefficients and gas fractions were low. Modeled Li, F, and S vapor–melt partition coefficients are higher than those of B and Cl. The decrease in maximum MI CO2 concentration following the earliest dacitic eruptions is interpreted to result from a broadening of the shallow storage region to greater than the diameter of subjacent feeders, so that greater proportions of reservoir magma were to the side of CO2-bearing vapor bubbles ascending vertically from the locus of recharge magma injection, thereby escaping recarbonation by streaming vapor bubbles. The Mazama melt inclusions provide a picture of a growing magma storage region, where chemical variations in melt and magma occur due to changes in the nature and supply rate of magma recharge, the timing of degassing, and the possible degree of equilibration with gases from below.},

Mazama, Crater Lake, Oregon, identify both 230Th-excess and 238U-excess components. U–Th isotope compositions cover a wide range, exceeding those previously measured for the Cascade arc. Age-corrected (230Th/232Th) and (238U/232Th) activity ratios range from 1.113 to 1.464 and from 0.878 to 1.572 (44.4 \% 230Th-excess to 8.8 \% 238U-excess), respectively. The most distinctive aspect of the data set is the contrast in U–Th isotope ratios between low and high Sr (LSr, HSr) components that have been previously identified in products of the 7.7 ka caldera-forming climactic eruption and preclimactic rhyodacite lavas. The LSr component exclusively contains 238U-excess, but the HSr component, as well as more primitive lavas, are marked by 230Th-excess. 230Th-excesses such as those recorded at Mt. Mazama are commonly observed in the Cascades. Melting models suggest that high 230Th-excesses observed in the more primitive lavas evolved through mixing of a mantle melt with a partial melt of a mafic lower crustal composition that contained garnet in the residuum that was produced through dehydration melting of amphibolite that was initially garnet free. Dehydration melting in the lower crust offers a solution to the “hot-slab paradox” of the Cascades, where low volatile contents are predicted due to high slab temperatures, yet higher water contents than expected have been documented in erupted lavas. The 238U-excess observed at Mt. Mazama is rare in Cascade lavas, but occurs in more than half of the samples analyzed in this study. Traditionally, 238U-excess in arc magmas is interpreted to reflect slab fluid fluxing. Indeed, 238U-excess in arcs is common and likely masks 230Th-excess resulting from lower crustal interaction. Isotopic and trace element data, however, suggest a relatively minor role for slab fluid fluxing in the Cascades. We propose that 238U-excess reflects melting and assimilation of young, hydrothermally altered upper crust. The processes related to generating 238U-excess are likely important features at Mt. Mazama that accompanied development of a large-scale silicic magma chamber that led to the caldera-forming eruption.},

	abstract = {The Rio Icacos basin, in Puerto Rico, is the site of the highest measured chemical solute fluxes for a catchment on granodiorite; this is partly attributable to high annual rainfall (4300 mm), high average temperature (23 °C), and moderate relief. The bulk of these fluxes is contributed by dissolution of plagioclase and amphiboles in zones of partially weathered rock (0.5–1.5 m thick) underlying saprolite. These zones are characterized by systems of onion-skin “rindlets” (each 3–10 cm thick) in which porosity development is dominated by weathering of plagioclase to kaolinite. Fe-bearing aluminosilicate minerals hornblende, augite, and biotite persist in the weathered rock after plagioclase has weathered to completion, but hornblende and augite disappear between the porous rindlet systems and saprolite. A new watershed-scale solute mass balance corroborates earlier studies and yields an overall reaction stoichiometry that closely resembles complete weathering of the rock (except quartz and biotite) to kaolinite and Fe3+ oxides. Our findings indicate that steady-state assumptions are reasonable and useful in studying weathering at this site. Estimated steady-state sediment yields (based on net solute fluxes and average bedrock composition) of 3.24×10−9 to 3.60×10−9 kg m−2 s−1 are smaller than measured values, indicating that sediment generation is currently accelerated with respect to steady-state; however, sediment generation has recently been closer to steady-state. Since weathering within the rindlet systems occurs on multiple fronts moving upward and downward, two new steady-state conceptual models are developed to account for (1) multiple parallel weathering fronts, and (2) differential rates of advance of weathering fronts due to porosity development. Based on these models, in situ weathering rates for plagioclase at two sample locations of 2.7×10−15 and 5.0×10−15 mol Na g−1 s−1 are calculated, values comparable to BET surface area normalized rates of 2.7×10−16 to 5.0×10−15 mol Na m−2 s−1.},

	abstract = {We have examined the behavior of Cr, Ni, Cu and Zn during the weathering of basaltic rocks in a moderate temperate climate. Samples of unweathered basaltic rocks, moderately weathered and strongly weathered equivalents were studied at six sites from the Massif Central of France. Unweathered basaltic rocks and basanites are rich in Cr (248–455 mg/kg) and Ni (126–237 mg/kg); all four elements are present in similar amounts in all three categories of sample. The location of these trace elements was investigated by optical and electron microscopy (EMPA, SEM–EDS). In unweathered basaltic rocks, Cr bearing phases are: chromian spinel (4–42 wt\%), Fe–Ti spinel (0.12–1.24 wt\%) and titanian augite (200–8000 mg/kg), whereas nickel is incorporated into forsterite (830–3600 mg/kg) and the spinel-group minerals (0.11–0.14 wt\%). Copper and Zn are found at lower concentrations, but regularly distributed in the phases studied. In weathered samples, authigenic phases fi ll fractures and also replace the primary minerals. They are composed of mixtures of clays, iron oxides and organic compounds. Authigenic phases contain lower amounts of those trace elements than primary minerals. Under conditions of moderate weathering, only 20 to 40\% of the total content in Cr, Ni, Cu and Zn appears to be mobile during the weathering of the basaltic rocks. As spinel-group minerals are not affected by strong weathering under a temperate climate, only the fraction of Cr, Ni and Zn present in the silicates of the unweathered basaltic rocks is released.},

fragments with some volcanic ashes, which are also indicated by
geochemical compositions representing for the nonclay silicate minerals
and low values of chemical index of alteration. No significant changes

characteristics suggest that chemical weathering of bedrocks on the
Barton Peninsula seems insignificant and that the soils are composed of
physically weathered mineral and rock fragments which are mixed with
eolian additions of volcanic ashes and Patagonian dusts.
Chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) distribution patterns of
the Barton Peninsula soils are slightly different from those of
bedrocks, indicating that the REE abundances and characteristics were
influenced by eolian additions. Mixing calculations, which mass-balance
the REEs, suggest that volcanic ashes blown from Deception Island were
the major eolian contributor, followed by atmospheric dusts sourced from
Patagonia, South America. Even in the warmer and humid climatic
conditions in the maritime Antarctic region, the chemical weathering of
bedrocks appears to be insignificant, probably due to the relatively
short duration of weathering since the last deglaciation.},

In the saprolites of the considered profile, depletion of V, Cr, Ni, Rb, Sr, Zr and Nb is observed. This is quite remarkable for Sr and Cr whereas REE and Y are enriched in the more altered portion of the profile and especially in its {\textless} 2-αm fraction. Such enrichment is associated with the LREE-HREE fractionation and the positive Ce anomaly. The former results from an increased solubility of HREE in a non-acid environment as well as from the removal of the HREE-rich phases from the residual component. The latter is related to the redox chemistry of Ce which, as CeO2, is less soluble than the other REE. No analogy is observed between the behaviour of Ce and Fe, Mn and Cr. Saprolites also exhibit a negative Eu anomaly which is mostly inherited from the parental material. Finally, the influence of accessory minerals in the REE distribution of weathering products and in sediments calls for a careful evaluation of preferential settling phenomena of heavy minerals during transportation and deposition processes. This is especially true in the parent material-sediment relationships.},

This geochemical signature can be traced from Scania to the Oslo Region, i.e. in areas approximately 500 km apart, but is not present in Middle Ordovician sediments from Avalonia. The geochemical signature matches island arc tholeiites such as those in the Fundsjø Group within the Upper Allochthon of the Norwegian-Swedish Caledonides. Hence, these sediments were probably predominantly derived from island arcs formed during the end phase of closure of the Iapetus Ocean. Simple two component mixing calculations between oceanic and continental sediment sources suggest that the oceanic component diminishes towards the south where modifications related to longer sediment transport distances can be recognised. The introduction of sediment derived from island arcs coincides with increases in subsidence rates in the Oslo Region and may reflect an early stage in foreland basin development. The presence of the geochemical signature in Scania implies that island arcs systems were geographically widespread. The combined evidence indicates that the Arenig/Llanvirn boundary marks an important change in the continuing closure of the Iapetus Ocean. The data suggest that island arcs were obducted onto the outer margins of Baltica presumably during the Arenig. Continued obduction of island arcs in the Mid Ordovician and younger intervals is likely.},

	abstract = {A suite of Australian shales, greywackes and subgreywackes ranging in age from Proterozoic to Triassic were analyzed for the rare earth elements (REE) in order to detect any secular changes in rare earth distribution. These post-Archean sediments show remarkably similar relative rare earth patterns. They are characterized by negative Eu anomalies of almost constant magnitude (average Eu/Eu∗ = 0.67 ± 0.05) relative to chondrites and nearly constant ratios of light to heavy rare earths (average ∑LREE/∑HREE = 9.7 ± 1.8). The REE abundances are generally higher in the younger sediments which may suggest that the absolute abundances of the rare earths in clastic sediments have gradually increased with time. Since no secular change in relative rare earth distribution was detected in the post-Archean sediments, a uniform process of crustal growth and evolution seems to have operated over the past 1500 million years at least. Australites show rare earth distributions very similar to that of the average clastic sediment. This suggests that the tektite parent material originated in the upper crust.},

	abstract = {Metasediments in the three early Palaeozoic Ross orogenic terranes in northern Victoria Land and Oates Land (Antarctica) are geochemically classified as immature litharenites to wackes and moderately mature shales. Highly mature lithotypes with Chemical Index of Weathering values of {\textgreater} 95 are typically absent. Geochemical and Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotope results indicate that the turbiditic metasediments of the Cambro-Ordovician Robertson Bay Group in the eastern Robertson Bay Terrane represent a very homogeneous series lacking significant compositional variations. Major variations are only found in chemical parameters which reflect differences in degree of chemical weathering of their protoliths and in mechanical sorting of the detritus. Geochemical data, 87Sr/ 86Sr t=490 Ma ratios of 0.7120 – 0.7174, εNd, t=490 Ma values of -7.6 to –10.3 and single-stage Nd-model ages of 1.7 – 1.9 Ga are indicative of an origin from a chemically evolved crustal source of on average late Palaeoproterozoic formation age. There is no evidence for significant sedimentary infill from primitive “ophiolitic” sources. Metasediments of the Middle Cambrian Molar Formation (Bowers Terrane) are compositionally strongly heterogeneous. Their major and trace element data and Sm-Nd isotope data (εNd, t=500 Ma values of -14.3 to -1.2 and single-stage Nd-model ages of 1.7 – 2.1 Ga) can be explained by mixing of sedimentary input from an evolved crustal source of at least early Palaeoproterozoic formation age and from a primitive basaltic source. The chemical heterogeneity of metasediments from the Wilson Terrane is largely inherited from compositional variations of their precursor rocks as indicated by the Ni vs TiO2 diagram. Single-stage Nd-model ages of 1.6 -2.2 Ga for samples from more western inboard areas of the Wilson Terrane (εNd, t=510 Ma -7.0 to -14.3) indicate a relatively high proportion of material derived from a crustal source with on average early Palaeoproterozoic formation age. Metasedimentary series in an eastern, more outboard position (εNd, t=510 Ma -5.4 to -10.0; single-stage Nd model ages 1.4 – 1.9) on the contrary document stronger influence of a more primitive source with younger formation ages. The chemical and isotopic characteristics of metasediments from the Bowers and Wilson terranes can be explained by variable contributions from two contrasting sources: a cratonic continental crust similar to the Antarctic Shield exposed in Georg V Land and Terre Adélie some hundred kilometers west of the study area and a primitive basaltic source probably represented by the Cambrian island-arc of the Bowers Terrane. While the data for metasediments of the Robertson Bay Terrane are also compatible with an origin from an Antarctic-Shield-type source, there is no direct evidence from their geochemistry or isotope geochemistry for an island-arc component in these series.},

The SiO2 content in them ranges from 60.58 to 65.26 wt.\%. Chemical Index of weathering (CIW) values varies between 50 and 65. 4 indicating a low degree of chemical alteration of the provenance rocks. A high degree of correlation between K2O and Al2O3 (r=−0.73) and low Rb/Sr ratios also suggest a low degree of alteration of provenance rocks. Abundances of transition group elements (Cr=118–221; N=89–154; V=89–192 and Sc=11–16 ppm) as well Zr (132–191 ppm) suggest a mixed mafic–felsic provenance for the metagreywackes. Low HREE and Y content, and low Tb/Yb ratios (0.23–0.41) suggest the presence of tonalite as an important component in the provenance areas. Values of Eu/Eu⁎(0.78) and Th/Sc (0.55) suggest that the granodioritic upper crust had evolved prior to serving as the provenance.

	abstract = {The Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic Transvaal Supergroup in South Africa contains the well-preserved stromatolitic Campbellrand-Malmani carbonate platform, which was deposited in shallow seawater shortly before the 2.40–2.32Ga Great Oxidation Event (GOE). This platform is composed of alternating stromatolitic carbonates and mudstones and is a prominent candidate for (isotope-) geochemical mapping to investigate the appearance of very small amounts of free oxygen that accumulated in shallow waters preceding the GOE. Mo isotopes in sedimentary archives are widely used as a proxy for redox-changes in modern and ancient environments and recent evidence suggests that oxy-molybdate (MoO42−) is directly transferred from ocean water to inorganic carbonates with negligible fractionation, thus reflecting oceanic Mo isotope signatures. In this study we analyzed major and trace element compositions as well as Mo isotopic compositions of carbonate and mudstone samples from the KMF-5 drill core. Geochemical indicators, such as Fe and Mn concentrations and Fe-to-Mn abundance ratios reveal the preservation of some geochemical indicators despite the widespread silicification and dolomitization of the platform. Heavy δ30Si values of silicified carbonates between 0.53 and 2.35‰ point to Si precipitation from surface water during early diagenesis rather than to a later hydrothermal overprint. This assessment is supported by the frequent observation of rip-up structures of silica (chert) layers within the entire sedimentary succession. The δ98Mo values of whole rock samples throughout the Malmani-Campbellrand platform range between −0.82 and +1.40‰, similar to values reported for deeper slope carbonates from the Griqualand West area, but variations are independent from lithology or depositional water depth. These large variations in δ98Mo values indicate molybdenum redox cycling and thus the presence of free oxygen in the atmosphere-ocean system at that time, in agreement with earlier Mo isotopic studies on Campbellrand carbonates and shales. A similar range in δ98Mo values for carbonates between +0.40 and +0.87‰, however, was also found on the hand specimen scale, indicating the danger of a sample bias on the Mo isotopic stratigraphy of this carbonate platform. Results of previously unpublished adsorption experiments of Mo on CaCO3 clearly indicate that the Mo inventory of Malmani-Campbellrand carbonates was not only influenced by primary adsorption from seawater, but to a much larger degree by secondary processes during early diagenesis, which also affected the Mo isotopic composition of the samples on a local scale. Our results indicate that Mo concentrations and isotopic compositions in ancient stromatolitic carbonates were subject to redox changes within microbial mats and within the soft sediment during early diagenesis and later lithification, and as such cannot be used to quantitatively reconstruct the amount of free atmospheric oxygen or its fluctuations through Earth's history. Nevertheless, we interpret our heavy Mo isotopic signatures from carbonates as a minimum value for Neoarchean seawater and reinforce the assumption that free atmospheric oxygen built up a heavy oceanic Mo reservoir at that time.},

	abstract = {Post-glacial Permian coal-bearing sedimentary successions are traditionally interpreted as fluvially deposited within the Gondwanaland continental set-up throughout the globe. Recent attempts to reinterpret such successions in terms of marine flooding events, mainly based on sedimentological and ichnological attributes, raised doubt on the existing palaeogeographic model of the Late Palaeozoic Gondwanaland. Reassessing these sedimentary successions using other proxies, like petrographic and geochemical properties, may provide more reliable clues to improve the present understanding. In this paper, petrographic and geochemical analysis of sandstones, sandstone–mudstone heteroliths, and mudstones of the early Permian Barakar Formation of Lower Gondwana Supergroup, Raniganj coal Basin, India, is presented to understand the provenance, palaeoweathering pattern and palaeodepositional conditions. Petrographically, the sandstones are arkosic to sub-arkosic in nature, with abundant unstable components and heavy minerals. Clay minerals in the matrix and the mudstones are dominated by kaolinite, illite-smectite with authigenic glauconite, indicating a marine diagenetic realm. Mineralogical assemblage attests to sedimentation in craton interior passive margin conditions. Geochemically, the lithounits show large variations in major element and trace element (including rare earth element) concentrations. Chemical index of alteration and A–CN–K ternary plot indicate moderate to strong chemical weathering, leading to deposition of compositionally immature sediments close to their source without much recycling. Ratios of major elements (e.g., MgO, K2O, Fe2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2) signify a continental–marine transitional depositional environment developed in a stable passive margin setting under gradually warming up climatic conditions. Trace element ratios manifest an estuarine depositional setting during Barakar sedimentation, comparable with modern major river mouth estuaries. Thus, this paper provides unequivocal evidence of significant marine influence during sedimentation in the Lower Gondwana basins in India, particularly during the Permian time, and signifies the importance of re-examining the so called “continental fluvial” coal-bearing deposits as considerably marine-influenced. The interpretations provide important clues in understanding and reconstructing the Permian Lower Gondwana palaeogeography in eastern peninsular India.},

	abstract = {The late Archean volcano-sedimentary succession of the Rampur group (RG) represents the oldest superacrustal rocks exposed in the Himalayas. The sedimentary component is pelite dominated in the lower part and siliciclastic (with associated mafic volcanics) dominated in the upper part, indicating shallowing of the basin over time. The bulk chemistry of the RG pelites shows illite–chlorite control that gets diluted with increase in quartz content. They have a general similarity with the post-Archean shales but a slightly higher average SiO2 and lower Al2O3 contents and severe depletion in CaO, Na2O, Sr and Ba relative to the North American shale composite. REE patterns are highly fractionated with (La/Yb)N ratio ranging from 8.8 to 18.6; HREE show slight fractionation [(average=Gd/Yb)N {\textless}2], and all the samples have large negative Eu anomalies (average, 0.61). (La/Yb)N decrease with increase in Al2O3/Na2O, but lack any relationship with K2O, thereby discounting clay mineral control. HREE have a positive correlation with TiO2, Th, Y and Nb but not with P2O5 and Zr. The increase in HREE seems likely due to the increased mobilization of HREE-enriched phase(s) during intense weathering. High Zr and Th contents and Th/Ni, La/Sc and (La/Yb)N ratios as well as Sc–Th/Sc relations favor a dominantly felsic source with only a minor contribution from mafic rocks. The most likely source lithology, compatible with the southerly paleocurrent direction and first cycle-sediment textural features of the RG sediments, appears to be the banded gneissic complex (BGC) of the northern Indian shield. The same conclusion is reached when RG data are plotted in Al2O3–CaO+Na2O–K2O (A–CN–K) compositional space, the data define a trend which indicates unweathered plagioclase-K-feldspar source composition similar to that of the BGC. Pre-metasomatized high chemical index of weathering as well as the high plagioclase index of weathering for a majority of the samples conforms to the world-wide warm, moist climate prevalent during the time of their deposition.},

	abstract = {In the geosciences, isotopic ratios and trace element concentrations are often used along with major element concentrations to help determine sources of and processes affecting geochemical variation. Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA) is a set of tools, generally attuned to major element data, concerned with the proper statistical treatment and removal of spurious correlations from compositional data. Though recent insights have been made on the incorporation of trace elements and stable isotope ratios to CoDA, this study provides a general approach to thinking about how radiogenic isotopes, stable isotopes, and trace elements fit with major elements in the CoDA framework. In the present study, we use multiple data sets of deep formation brines and compare traditional mixing models to their CoDA counterparts to examine fluid movement between reservoirs. Concentrations of individual isotopes are calculated using isotopic ratios and global mean isotopic abundances. One key result is that isotope parts (e.g. 1818{\textasciicircum}\{18\}O, 1717{\textasciicircum}\{17\}O, 1616{\textasciicircum}\{16\}O, 22{\textasciicircum}\{2\}H, 11{\textasciicircum}\{1\}H, 8787{\textasciicircum}\{87\}Sr, 8686{\textasciicircum}\{86\}Sr) can simply be modelled by the major element concentration (H22\_\{2\}O, Sr) in a clr-biplot as they are perfectly dependent. Another important result is that an ilr transformation of radiogenic isotope parts (e.g. 8686{\textasciicircum}\{86\}Sr and 8787{\textasciicircum}\{87\}Sr in 8787{\textasciicircum}\{87\}Sr/8686{\textasciicircum}\{86\}Sr) and trace elements can, like stable isotopes in delta notation, be treated as a linear function of the isotopic ratio or trace element concentration, scaled only by a constant. This implies that there are multiple situations in which an ilr transformation provides little additional insight for the analysis of trends: (1) any two parts with low log ratio variance (e.g. an isotope ratio), no matter their concentrations in the solution, (2) any low concentration parts (trace elements) or a ratio of a trace to a major element, no matter the variance of the elements, and (3) large positive ratios (major/trace) over a restricted range of variance. Similarly, a multivariate ilr transformation of a large data set with many parts will also be a simple perturbation if the balances are evenly split between parts. CoDA transformations, however, even if they do not provide new insight in some specific cases, will provide consistent interpretations for all types of data.},

	abstract = {Chemical weathering contributes to the regulation of the global carbon cycle and biogeochemical cycles. Accordingly, the identification of the parameters that control weathering reactions and transport of weathering signals at the catchment scale is essential. The use of boron (B) isotopes have been shown to be a useful proxy in tracing weathering reactions due to large isotope fractionation during weathering processes. However, our knowledge of how boron isotopes record the weathering regime at the catchment scale and how that weathering signal is transported from source areas to the depositional environment remains limited. Here we characterize B isotope and major element behavior during chemical weathering and transport by analyzing the B isotopic (δ11B) and element compositions of riverine material (riverbank sands ({\textless} 63 µm), clay fractions ({\textless}2 µm) extracted from sands, and dissolved load) along the course of the Murrumbidgee River (NSW, Australia), its upstream tributaries, and monolithologic subcatchments. In the Murrumbidgee, two distinct weathering regimes are present, one where mineral dissolution is associated with minimal neoformation at higher elevations and another where mineral neoformation dominates at lower elevations and in granitic lithologies. Significant B isotope difference between the clay fraction and the bedrock (Δ11Bclay-bedrock) is observed in most monolithological catchments at high mean elevation (excluding granites), which correlates with a large B depletion. Smaller isotope difference between the clay fraction and bedrock is observed in monolithological catchments at lower elevations as well as in granitic catchments at all elevations and is associated with limited B removal. These results suggest that lithology and catchment topography influence B mobility during weathering and the isotopic composition of weathering products. By mass balance calculation, the B isotope and chemical composition of the clay and sand fractions in the Murrumbidgee River can be explained as a mixture of the clays and sands produced throughout the catchment delivered to the main channel by the tributaries. These results indicate that there is little or no chemical and isotopic modification of the river sediment during fluvial transport and that weathering signal produced in the sediment source areas is transferred to the depositional environment without significant modification. The boron content of the clay-sized fraction (∼40 ppm) is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the dissolved load while B isotope compositions of the clay-sized fraction are isotopically much lighter (up to 40 ‰). Because a maximum isotopic difference of 30 ‰ between the dissolved and solid phases is expected during adsorption processes, the observed isotope compositions in the dissolved load and the sediment clay fraction cannot be explained by pH-driven B partitioning. These observations suggest that clays are not directly precipitating from solutions compositionally similar to surface waters; deeper soil solutions are expected to play a significant role in clay formation. This research highlights the potential of B isotopes in river sediments to describe the present and past weathering regimes at the catchment scale, including possible paleoenvironment reconstruction as the B isotope signature of riverine material records the conditions of its formation.},

Wavecut platforms mantled by 2–6 m of marine terrace cover deposits are separated by 10–50 m tall decaying sea cliffs. Paleocliff edges become more rounded with age, yet the details of the profiles and frequent bedrock exposure on the upper slopes imply weathering-limited transport. Five bedrock stream channels etched through the marine terrace sequence display one to three distinct convexities in their longitudinal profiles. Detailed hand level surveys of the hillslopes and of the stream channel longitudinal profiles constrain hillslope evolution and channel incision components of a numerical model of landscape evolution. We account for regolith production as a function of regolith depth. In accord with the field observation that hillslope processes are presently dominated by the activities of burrowing rodents, the transport process is taken to be diffusive. Stream incision is assumed to be controlled by stream power, for which we use the surrogate of local drainage area-slope product. Best fits of the numerical model to field data imply: hillslope diffusivity is 10 m2 kyr−1; regolith production rate on bare bedrock is 0.3 m kyr−1, and falls off rapidly with regolith cover, and the constant controlling the efficiency of stream incision is 5 to 7×10−7m−1 kyr1.},

The arrangement of divides and valleys is sensitive to initial conditions, although average morphology is insensitive. Dissected, initially flat surfaces in which downstream concavity is slight exhibit nearly parallel drainage, compared to very wandering main valleys when concavity is great. Steady state is reached after a cumulative base level drop approximately 3 times the final relief. Simulated valley systems are similar to those predicted by a previous model of optimal drainage basins.

Simulated processes rely on a simplified mathematical representation of landscape processes \&ndash; the stream power and creep laws \&ndash; to compute Earth's surface evolution by rivers and hillslope transport. The main difference with previous models is in the underlying numerical formulation of the mathematical equations. The approach is based on a series of implicit iterative algorithms defined in matrix form to calculate both drainage area from multiple flow directions and erosion/deposition processes. eSCAPE relies on PETSc parallel library to solve these matrix systems. Along with the description of the algorithms, examples are provided and illustrate the model current capabilities and limitations. eSCAPE is the first landscape evolution model able to simulate processes at global scale and is primarily designed to address problems on large unstructured grids (several millions of nodes).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

When the silicate-rich rocks and minerals in Earth's interior are uplifted and exposed to Earth's surface, they dissolve. On a geologic time scale, this chemical weathering process ultimately creates a sink for CO2, thereby influencing global temperatures. Maher and Chamberlain (p. 1502, published online 13 March) developed a theoretical framework for understanding the fundamental relationship between weathering, tectonics, and the geological carbon cycle. The analysis suggests that temperature plays less of a role in regulating chemical weathering—which is dependent on the balance of tectonic uplift and erosion—than runoff on continents and the time that silicate minerals are exposed to fluids. Plateaus in weathering fluxes with increasing runoff or temperature allows for the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 despite high rates of uplift or erosion.
Earth’s temperature is thought to be regulated by a negative feedback between atmospheric CO2 levels and chemical weathering of silicate rocks that operates over million-year time scales. To explain variations in the strength of the weathering feedback, we present a model for silicate weathering that regulates climatic and tectonic forcing through hydrologic processes and imposes a thermodynamic limit on weathering fluxes, based on the physical and chemical properties of river basins. Climate regulation by silicate weathering is thus strongest when global topography is elevated, similar to the situation today, and lowest when global topography is more subdued, allowing planetary temperatures to vary depending on the global distribution of topography and mountain belts, even in the absence of appreciable changes in CO2 degassing rates.
Consumption of carbon dioxide through silicate weathering is regulated by the intensity of the hydrologic cycle.

	abstract = {We describe and apply a method for estimating uplift rate histories from longitudinal river profiles. Our strategy is divided into three parts. First, we develop a forward model, which calculates river profiles from uplift rate histories. Height variation along a river profile is controlled by uplift rate and moderated by the erosional process. We assume that the erosional process can be represented by a combination of advection and diffusion, which are parameterized using four erosional constants. Second, we have posed and solved the geologically more interesting inverse problem: which uplift rate history minimizes the misfit between calculated and observed river profiles? The inverse algorithm has been tested on synthetic river profiles, which demonstrates that uplift rate histories can be reliably retrieved. Our tests show that the erosional process is dominated by advection (i.e., knickpoint retreat) and that changes in lithology and discharge play a secondary role in determining the transient form of a river profile. Finally, we have inverted river profiles from a series of African topographic swells, namely the Bié, South African, Namibian, Hoggar, and Tibesti domes. Fits between calculated and observed river profiles are excellent. Calculated uplift rate histories suggest that these domes grew rapidly during the last 30–40 million years. Uplift rate histories vary significantly from dome to dome but cumulative uplift histories agree closely with independent geologic estimates.},

When a region adjacent to a reference level (e.g., sea level) is uplifted, a rapid change in gradient occurs near the river mouth. The erosional process causes this change in gradient to migrate upstream. Thus a river profile is effectively a ‘tape recording’ of the uplift rate history, provided that the erosional process can be adequately parameterized. Here, we use a non-linear equation to relate the shape of a river profile, z(x), to uplift rate history, U(t). If erosion is assumed to be dominated by knickpoint retreat, an inverse model can be formulated and used to calculate uplift rate histories. Our model builds upon standard stream profile analysis, which focuses on the relationship between profile slope and drainage area. We have applied this analytical approach to river profiles from the Bié Dome, Angola. Calculated uplift rate histories agree with independent geologic estimates.},

	abstract = {Understanding how environmental forcings (e.g., tectonics, climate) are transformed by erosional landscapes into sedimentary signals is a critical component of inverting the stratigraphic record. Previous research has largely focused on sediment supply (Qs) and grain size as the de facto sedimentary signals of changing forcing mechanisms. We use a numerical model to consider the paired response of sediment provenance (Pv), expressed as fractional sediment load, and Qs to demonstrate that the same change in environmental forcing may have a different expression in the sedimentary record. While Qs reflects integrated denudation across an erosional catchment, Pv is controlled by spatially variable erosion that occurs in transient landscapes. Pv from proximal sediment sources increases during upstream knickpoint migration, whereas Pv from distal sediment sources increases when bedrock channels incise to produce lower gradient profiles. Differences between the Qs and Pv signals relate to distinct geomorphic processes that operate on different time scales and allow for a refined differentiation of the timing and mechanism of forcings than possible via analysis of either signal alone. Future efforts to integrate multiple sedimentary signals may thus yield a richer picture of underlying forcing mechanisms, facilitating efforts to invert the stratigraphic record.},

	abstract = {Despite its importance, the temporal and spatial evolution of continental dynamic topography is poorly known. Australia’s isolation from active plate boundaries and its rapid northward motion within a hot spot reference frame make it a useful place to investigate the interplay between mantle convection, topography, and drainage. Oﬀshore, dynamic topography is relatively well constrained and can be accounted for by Australia’s translation over the mantle’s convective circulation. To build a database of onshore constraints, we have analyzed an inventory of longitudinal river proﬁles, which is sensitive to uplift rate history. Using independently constrained erosional parameters, we determine uplift rates by minimizing the misﬁt between observed and calculated river proﬁles. Resultant ﬁts are excellent and calculated uplift histories match independent geologic constraints. We infer that western and central Australia underwent regional uplift during the last 50 Myr and that the Eastern Highlands have been uplifted in two stages. The ﬁrst stage from 120 to 80 Ma, coincided with rifting along the eastern margin and its existence is supported by thermochronological measurements. A second stage occurred at 80–10 Ma, formed the Great Escarpment, and coincided with Cenozoic volcanism. The relationship between topography, gravity anomalies, and shear wave tomographic models suggest that regional elevation is supported by temperature anomalies within the lithosphere’s thermal boundary layer. Morphology and stratigraphy of the Eastern Highlands imply that these anomalies have been coupled to the base of the plate during Australia’s northward motion over the last 70 Myr.},

The progress of the decomposition is interpreted from a series of six samples of residual clay. Kaolinite is an end product. New chemical analyses of material from the Medford, Massachusetts, diabase are presented as a check on the older data. Ferrous and ferric iron determinations on samples of diabase and of glacial till suggest that the till is less oxidized than the underlying diabase, indicating preglacial weathering of the diabase. A diabase on the north shore of Lake Superior, Minnesota, is weathered locally to a depth of 40 feet but shows little chemical change except oxidation. An amphibolite from the Black Hills, South Dakota, yielded beidellite or related clay minerals by decomposition of its hornblende. Calcite has been leached, and other minerals attacked. On the basis of the present and earlier studies, a mineral-stability series in weathering is proposed. The arrangement of the common rock-forming minerals in this series is found to coincide with the reaction series. Experimental work on the attack of silicate minerals by water is in accord with the suggested mineral-stability series.},

Point counts of inclusions exposed in talus blocks from the dome from 1980 through 1983 show that inclusions form approximately 3.5 vol\% of the lava. Eighty-five percent of the inclusions are medium-grained gabbros with an average diameter of 6 cm. Additional rock types include quartz diorite, hornfelsic basalt, dacite, andesite and vein quartz. Disaggregated inclusions are common and define shear planes within the dome. These fragmented inclusions may significantly contaminate analyses of the dacite. The gabbroic inclusions are of four distinct types, all with mineral assemblages consistent with crystallization pressures of less than 9 kb. Textures and major-element compositions indicate that most of the gabbroic inclusions are cumulates. The most abundant inclusion type is laminated gabbronorite, which contains up to 9\% interstitial glass, derived from partial melting. The presence of quartz veins and hornblende-bearing veins within sheared zones in the laminated gabbronorite indicates that the source of these inclusions was holocrystalline rock that had been penetrated by water-rich fluids. The gabbronorite contained sufficient water to be susceptible to partial melting when the magma that fed the 1980–1986 eruption sequence was emplaced nearby. Various types of gabbroic inclusions, including the laminated gabbronorite, are common in Mount St. Helens lavas of approximately the last 3000 years. This coincides with the interval in which Mount St. Helens first erupted basalt and basaltic andesite lavas. These observations, together with the fact that the gabbroic inclusions are compositionally unlike any of the Tertiary intrusive rocks in the Mount St. Helens area, strongly suggest that the inclusions are related to the introduction of basalt to the Mount St. Helens magmatic system. The source of the gabbros could be a layered mafic pluton formed through crystal accumulation from multiple batches of basaltic magma emplaced at mid-to upper-crustal depths beneath the volcano. The prevalence of explosive eruptions at Mount St. Helens may play a part in bringing the inclusions to the surface. The eruptive products of the cataclysmic eruption of May 18,1980 contain notably fewer inclusions than the pyroclastic flows and dome lavas erupted subsequently. This suggests that the May 18 eruption shattered conduit wall rock that was subsequently stoped into the magma and carried to the surface later in the eruption series.},

	abstract = {Decades of field and microscope studies, and more recent quantitative 
geochemical analyses have resulted in a vast, and sometimes
overwhelming, array of nomenclature and terminology associated with
igneous rocks. This book presents a complete classification of igneous
rocks based on all the recommendations of the International Union of
Geological Sciences (IUGS) Subcommission on the Systematics of Igneous
Rocks. The glossary of igneous terms has been fully updated since the
first edition and now includes 1637 entries, of which 316 are
recommended by the Subcommission. Incorporating a comprehensive
bibliography of source references for all the terms included in the
glossary, this book is an indispensable reference guide for all
geologists studying igneous rocks, either in the field or the
laboratory. It presents a standardised and widely accepted naming scheme
that will allow geologists to interpret terminology in the primary
literature and provide formal names for rock samples based on
petrographic analyses. It is also supported by a website with
downloadable code for chemical classifications.},

	abstract = {A new calculation of the crustal composition is based on the proportions of upper crust (UC) to felsic lower crust (FLC) to mafic lower crust (MLC) of about 1:0.6:0.4. These proportions are derived from a 3000 km long refraction seismic profile through western Europe (EGT) comprising 60\% old shield and 40\% younger fold belt area with about 40 km average Moho depth. A granodioritic bulk composition of the UC in major elements and thirty-two minor and trace elements was calculated from the Canadian Shield data (Shaw et al., 1967, 1976). The computed abundance of thirty-three additional trace elements in the UC is based on the following proportions of major rock units derived from mapping: 14\% sedimentary rocks, 25\% granites, 20\% granodiorites, 5\% tonalites, 6\% gabbros, and 30\% gneisses and mica schists. The composition of FLC and MLC in major and thirty-six minor and trace elements is calculated from data on felsic granulite terrains and mafic xenoliths, respectively, compiled by Rudnick and Presper (1990). More than thirty additional trace element abundances in FLC and MLC were computed or estimated from literature data. The bulk continental crust has a tonalitic and not a dioritic composition with distinctly higher concentrations of incompatible elements including the heat producing isotopes in our calculation. A dioritic bulk crust was suggested by Taylor and McLennan (1985). The amount of tonalite in the crust requires partial melting of mafic rocks with about 100 km thickness (compared with about 7 km in the present MLC) and water supply from dehydrated slabs and mafic intrusions. At the relatively low temperatures of old crustal segments MLC was partly converted into eclogite which could be recycled into the upper mantle under favourable tectonic conditions. The chemical fractionation of UC against FLC + MLC was caused by granitoidal partial melts and by mantle degassing which has controlled weathering and accumulation of volatile compounds close to the Earth's surface.},

As proportions are expressed as real numbers, one is tempted to interpret, or even analyze, them as real multivariate data. This chapter presents some simple examples that illustrate the anomalous behavior of proportions when analyzed without taking into account the special characteristics of compositional data. As stated in Aitchison and Egozcue (2005), the way to deal with this type of compositional data has gone through roughly four phases, which is summarized in the chapter. This book deals with the fourth phase. The recognition of the algebraic-geometric structure of the sample space of compositions led to the staying-in-the-simplex approach for the analysis of compositional problems. The book summarizes the state of the art in the stay-in-the-simplex approach. It reviews algebraic-geometric structure of the simplex, which is called as Aitchison geometry.},

	abstract = {Seismic techniques provide the highest-resolution measurements of the structure of the crust and have been conducted on a worldwide basis. We summarize the structure of the continental crust based on the results of seismic refraction profiles and infer crustal composition as a function of depth by comparing these results with high-pressure laboratory measurements of seismic velocity for a wide range of rocks that are commonly found in the crust. The thickness and velocity structure of the crust are well correlated with tectonic province, with extended crust showing an average thickness of 30.5 km and orogens an average of 46.3 km. Shields and platforms have an average crustal thickness nearly equal to the global average. We have corrected for the nonuniform geographical distribution of seismic refraction profiles by estimating the global area of each major crustal type. The weighted average crustal thickness based on these values is 41.1 km. This value is 10\% to 20\% greater than previous estimates which underrepresented shields, platforms, and orogens. The average compressional wave velocity of the crust is 6.45 km/s, and the average velocity of the uppermost mantle (Pn velocity) is 8.09 km/s. We summarize the velocity structure of the crust at 5-km depth intervals, both in the form of histograms and as an average velocity-depth curve, and compare these determinations with new measurements of compressional wave velocities and densities of over 3000 igneous and metamorphic rock cores made to confining pressures of 1 GPa. On the basis of petrographic studies and chemical analyses, the rocks have been classified into 29 groups. Average velocities, densities, and standard deviations are presented for each group at 5-km depth intervals to crustal depths of 50 km along three different geotherms. This allows us to develop a model for the composition of the continental crust. Velocities in the upper continental crust are matched by velocities of a large number of lithologies, including many low-grade metamorphic rocks and relatively silicic gneisses of amphibolite facies grade. In midcrustal regions, velocity gradients appear to originate from an increase in metamorphic grade, as well as a decrease in silica content. Tonalitic gneiss, granitic gneiss, and amphibolite are abundant midcrustal lithologies. Anisotropy due to preferred mineral orientation is likely to be significant in upper and midcrustal regions. The bulk of the lower continental crust is chemically equivalent to gabbro, with velocities in agreement with laboratory measurements of mafic granulite. Garnet becomes increasingly abundant with depth, and mafic garnet granulite is the dominant rock type immediately above the Mohorovicic discontinuity. Average compressional wave velocities of common crustal rock types show excellent correlations with density. The mean crustal density calculated from our model is 2830 kg/m3, and the average SiO2 content is 61.8\%.},

However, the parental magmas of continents were basaltic, which means they must have lost Mg relative to Si during their maturation into continents. Igneous differentiation followed by lower crustal delamination and chemical weathering followed by subduction recycling are possible solutions, but the relative magnitudes of each process have never been quantitatively constrained because of the lack of appropriate data. Here, we show that the relative contributions of these processes can be obtained by simultaneous examination of Mg and Li (an analog for Mg) on the regional and global scales in arcs, delaminated lower crust, and river waters. At least 20\% of Mg is lost from continents by weathering, which translates into {\textgreater}20\% of continental mass lost by weathering (40\% by delamination). Chemical weathering leaves behind a more Si-rich and Mg-poor crust, which is less dense and hence decreases the probability of crustal recycling by subduction. Net continental growth is thus modulated by chemical weathering and likely influenced by secular changes in weathering mechanisms.},

Sediment samples were obtained throughout most of the Amazon Basin. The range of exchangeable cation compositions is very narrow in the river and in seawater as well. In river water, the exchangeable cation complement (equivalent basis, exclusive of H+) is 80\% Ca2+, 17\% Mg2+, 3\% Na+ plus K+. In seawater Na+ and Mg2+ are about equal (38\%) while Ca2+ {\textasciitilde} 15\% and K+ {\textasciitilde} 9\%. On reaction with seawater, river suspended sediment took up an amount of Na+ equal to nearly one-third of the dissolved river load, as well as amounts corresponding to 15–20\% of the dissolved fluvial K+ and Mg2+. These estimates reflect an unusually high suspended-sediment:dissolved-solids ratio of 6.4 at the time of sampling. At a more representative world average ratio of four, the uptake of Na+ would be 20\% of the dissolved fluvial load, and that for K+ and Mg2+ about 10\%. Over the annual cycle of the Amazon, it is estimated that ion exchange has a still smaller effect, as a consequence of the low average suspended-solids:dissolved-solids ratio of 1.7. Variations in the ratio XCaXMg, the equivalent fraction of exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+, throughout the river, can be described by a single isotherm. This same isotherm accurately describes the distribution of exchangeable Ca2+ and Mg2+ on sediment equilibrated with seawater, despite that a high proportion of exchange sites is occupied by Na+ and K+.},

	abstract = {Continental-scale chemical weathering budgets are commonly assessed based on the ﬂux of dissolved elements carried by large rivers to the oceans. However, the interaction between sediments and seawater in estuaries can lead to additional cation exchange ﬂuxes that have been very poorly constrained so far. We constrained the magnitude of cation exchange ﬂuxes from the Ganga–Brahmaputra river system based on cation exchange capacity (CEC) measurements of riverine sediments. CEC values of sediments are variable throughout the river water column as a result of hydrological sorting of minerals with depth that control grain sizes and surface area. The average CEC of the integrated sediment load of the Ganga–Brahmaputra is estimated ca. 6.5 meq 100 g−1. The cationic charge of sediments in the river is dominated by bivalent ions Ca2+ (76 \%) and Mg2+ (16 \%) followed by monovalent K+ (6 \%) and Na+ (2 \%), and the relative proportion of these ions is constant among all samples and both rivers. Assuming a total exchange of exchangeable Ca2+ for marine Na+ yields a maximal additional Ca2+ ﬂux of 28 × 109 mol yr−1 of calcium to the ocean, which represents an increase of ca. 6 \% of the actual river dissolved Ca2+ ﬂux. In the more likely event that only a fraction of the adsorbed riverine Ca2+ is exchanged, not only for marine Na+ but also Mg2+ and K+, estuarine cation exchange for the Ganga–Brahmaputra is responsible for an additional Ca2+ ﬂux of 23 × 109 mol yr−1, while ca. 27 × 109 mol yr−1 of Na+, 8 × 109 mol yr−1 of Mg2+ and 4 × 109 mol yr−1 of K+ are re-absorbed in the estuaries. This represents an additional riverine Ca2+ ﬂux to the ocean of 5 \% compared to the measured dissolved ﬂux. About 15 \% of the dissolved Na+ ﬂux, 8 \% of the dissolved K+ ﬂux and 4 \% of the Mg2+ are reabsorbed by the sediments in the estuaries. The impact of estuarine sediment–seawater cation exchange appears to be limited when evaluated in the context of the long-term carbon cycle and its main effect is the sequestration of a signiﬁcant fraction of the riverine Na ﬂux to the oceans. The limited exchange ﬂuxes of the Ganga–Brahmaputra relate to the lower than average CEC of its sediment load that do not counterbalance the high sediment ﬂux to the oceans. This can be attributed to the nature of Himalayan river sediment such as low proportion of clays and organic matter.},

	abstract = {The Earth is an unusual planet in our solar system in having a bimodal topography that reflects the two distinct types of crust found on our planet. The low-lying oceanic crust is thin (˜7 km on average),
composed of relatively dense rock types such as basalt and is young (≤200 Ma old) (see Chapter 3.13). In contrast, the high-standing continental crust is thick (˜40 km on average), is composed of
highly diverse lithologies (virtually every rock type known on Earth) that yield an average intermediate or "andesitic" bulk composition (Taylor and McLennan (1985) and references therein), and contains the oldest rocks and minerals yet observed on Earth (currently the 4.0 Ga Acasta gneisses (Bowring and Williams, 1999) and 4.4 Ga detrital zircons from the Yilgarn Block, Western Australia (Wilde et al., 2001)), respectively. Thus, the continents preserve a rich geological history of our planet's evolution and understanding their origin is critical for understanding the origin and differentiation of the Earth.The origin of the continents has received wide attention within the geological community, with hundreds of papers and several books devoted to the topic (the reader is referred to the following general references for further reading: Taylor and McLennan (1985), Windley (1995), and Condie (1997). Knowledge of the age and composition of the continental crust is essential for understanding its origin. Patchett and Samson (Chapter 3.10) review the present-day age distribution of the continental crust and Kemp and Hawkesworth (Chapter 3.11) review secular evolution of crust composition. Moreover, to understand fully the origin and
evolution of continents requires an understanding of not only the crust, but also the mantle lithosphere that formed more-or-less
contemporaneously with the crust and translates with it as the
continents move across the Earth's surface. The latter topic is reviewed in Chapter 2.05.This chapter reviews the present-day composition of the continental crust, the methods employed to derive these estimates, and the implications of the continental crust composition for the formation of the continents, Earth differentiation, and its geochemical
inventories.},

	abstract = {Comminution in the glaciers that debouch into Guys Bight Basin, followed by selective sorting in the fluvial system, has had little effect on the bulk composition, or on the mineralogy, of the basin sands and muds. Most striking are the feldspar contents, and the feldspar-quartz ratios in sands and muds, both of which remain similar to those of average bedrock. The feldspar contents of sands and muds range from 48 to 52\% feldspar whereas average bedrock contains 51·7\% feldspar. Feldspar-quartz ratios average 1·58:1 in bedrock and 1·54:1, 1·66:1 and 1·69:1 in the medium to coarse sands, fine sands and muds, respectively, indicating minimal feldspar enrichment in the fine-grained sediments. In the absence of appreciable chemical weathering, extreme abrasion followed by hydraulic sorting has not produced mature sediments such as quartz arenites and clay-mineral-rich muds. There is, however, some chemical differentiation. Preferential accumulation of mafic minerals in fine sands and muds is reflected in bulk compositions by higher abundances of MgO, FeO and TiO2, and in the mineralogy by enrichment of biotite in the fine grades. Bulk compositional studies focused solely on muds and mudstones will result in an overestimate of the mafic contribution from source rocks. This work shows that bulk compositional studies of sediments and sedimentary rocks should include all available granulometric grades.},

Mobilisation of the REE probably results from pH changes of soil and ground waters as they encounter different chemical environments while fractionation may largely result from mineralogical controls. Submarine and subaerial weathering processes may affect REE similarly, producing intensively weathered materials appreciably depleted in the REE. Spilitisation and hydrothermal alteration processes may affect basaltic rocks in much the same way as do weathering processes.},

Degradation and leaching dominate the early weathering stages whereas during the advanced stages, exchange and adsorption onto clays are of most influence. The alkali and alkaline earth compositional changes in the Toorongo Granodiorite weathering profile are typical of changes occurring during weathering of the continents, consequently the following generalizations apply to continental weathering. Ca, Sr and Na are most rapidly and most strongly removed (as dissolved species) during weathering of fresh continental rocks. Although large quantities of Mg are transported to the marine environment as dissolved species, appreciable amounts remain (fixed in secondary clay minerals) at the weathering site to be removed during mass wasting of continental weathering profiles. Large quantities of Rb, Cs and Ba, fixed in continental weathering profiles by exchange and adsorption onto secondary clays, are transported from the continents only during mass wasting of the continents.},

	abstract = {This article investigates both experimentally and theoretically the compositional changes associated with textural effects and hydraulic sorting during sediment transport and deposition, which cause systematic distortion in quantitative provenance analysis (“environmental bias”). Traditional procedures aimed at eliminating textural noise find limited success. The Gazzi–Dickinson method cannot remove hydrodynamic-related modal variability. Multiple size-window strategies are time-consuming. Narrow or moving size-window strategies represent misleading or impractical short cuts, being less convenient options than simply analysing each sample in bulk. New concepts introduced here unravel the superposed causes of compositional variability in modern sediments. Intrasample modal variability, fundamentally explained by settling-equivalence relationships, can be accurately modelled mathematically. Intersample modal variability, principally resulting from selective entrainment, can be assessed and removed by a simple principle. In absence of provenance changes and environmental bias, the weighted average density of terrigenous grains (SRD index) should be equal, for each sample and each grain-size class of each sample, to the weighted average density of source rocks. By correcting relative abundances of detrital minerals in proportion to their densities, we can restore the appropriate SRD index for any provenance and subprovenance type in each sample or grain-size class. Modal variability is effectively reduced by this procedure, which can be applied confidently to modern sediments deposited by tractive currents in any environment. Good results are obtained even for placer sands and finest classes where heavy-mineral concentration is strongest. Such “SRD correction” also successfully compensates for biased narrow-window modes, thus providing a numerical solution of general validity to the problem of environmental bias in sedimentary petrology. After compensating for settling-equivalence and selective-entrainment effects, residual size-dependent compositional variability may be provenance-related. Minor in Ganga–Brahmaputra sediments, provenance-related effects are spectacularly displayed in the Nile basin, where volcaniclastic silt mixes with basement-derived quartzofeldspathic sand and wind-blown Saharan quartz.},

	abstract = {Size-fractions of soil and stream sediment developed on plutonic, metamorphic, or mixed plutonic-metamorphic sources in the Wet Mountains, Colorado, have been analyzed for REE (rare-earth elements) and mineralogy. The clay-sized fractions ({\textless}0.5-μm and 0.5–2-μm, or {\textless}2 μm) have REE contents that are similar to more enriched than the source, Eu/Sm ratios that are similar to the source and La/Lu ratios that are higher than their corresponding source. The {\textless}0.5-μm fractions have lower REE contents than the corresponding 0.5–2-μm fraction in every stream sediment. For example, unweathered San Isabel batholith near the sampled stream sediment contains ΣREE = 511–712 ppm, and EuSmratio = 0.17–0.19 and (LaLu)cn = 9.8–10.3. The corresponding {\textless}0.5- and 0.5–2-μm fractions of sediment formed from San Isabel batholith are enriched in the REE (ΣREE = 1135 and 2225 ppm, respec.), are slightly lower in Eu/Sm ratios (0.16 and 0.14, respec.) and are higher in La/Lu ratios (12.2 and 16.3, respec.) than the unweathered rocks. The silts have LREE (light REE) contents and Eu/Sm ratios very similar to the source (due to similar mineralogy), but silts have HREE (heavy REE) contents higher than the source (due to high zircon). For example, silt-sized fractions in stream sediment draining the San Isabel batholith contain ΣREE = 808 ppm, EuSmratio = 0.18 and (LaLu)cn = 7.4. In contrast, the sands contain lower REE contents, similar to higher Eu/Sm ratios and lower La/Lu ratios than the corresponding source due to depletion in heavy minerals (concentrated in the REE and containing lower Eu/Sm ratios) relative to quartz and feldspar (depleted in the REE and containing higher Eu/Sm ratios). For example, the sand fraction from stream sediment from the San Isabel batholith has ΣREE = 206 ppm, EuSmratio = 0.17 and (LaLu)cn = 5.6. Small variations of accessory minerals concentrated in the REE like allanite or sphene may cause drastic variation in REE content in the sand fraction. Clays and silts derived only from the plutonic rocks have higher REE and similar to lower Eu/Sm ratios than corresponding fractions derived only from migmatites (e.g., ΣREE of silt fractions from migmatites = 224 ppm and from plutons = 375–808 ppm; Eu/Sm ratios from migmatites = 0.17 and from plutons = 0.11–0.18). The REE content and the Eu/Sm ratio of clays and silts derived from migmatites are much more similar to the average of MCPS (mid-continent platform sediment) than corresponding fractions derived from the plutons (MCPS has ΣREE = 192 ppm; EuSm = 0.19; LaLu = 8.0). The EuSm ratio of sands derived from plutons and migmatite are lower to mostly higher than the MCPS. The REE content of sands from plutons are not necessarily higher than the MCPS due to variation in heavy minerals like allanite or sphene concentrated in the REE. Sediments derived from mixed sources have REE contents in fine-fractions that may not necessarily reflect the REE content of the nearest source. For example, 0.5–2-μm and silt fractions developed on the San Isabel batholith with a migmatite upstream have the high REE content of the batholith (ΣREE in 0.5–2-μm fraction = 1100 ppm; silt = 573 ppm) while the corresponding {\textless}0.5-μm fraction has the very low REE content of the migmatites (ΣREE = 110 ppm). These results suggest fine-grained material near the source may sample a much larger area than coarser material near the source. Thus, analysis of fine-grained sediment associated with coarse-grained material near the source may give a much different impression of the source than would determination of the source using classic petrographic examination of the sand or gravels.},

	abstract = {The average chemical composition of juvenile upper continental crust (UC) as a function of age is estimated from chemical analyses, geologic maps, stratigraphic sections and isotopic ages. High plutonic/supracrustal ratios in Archean UC may reflect in part a different mode of crustal formation prior to 2.5 Ga. Greenstones show an increase in felsic volcanics and graywackes in post-Archean successions, a drop almost to zero in the proportion of komatiites at the Archean-Proterozoic (A/P) boundary, and an increase in the proportion of andesites in the Phanerozoic. Compared to the Early Archean, Late and post-Archean UC are depleted in Mg, Cr, Ni and Co, and post-Archean UC is enriched in LILE (large-ion lithophile elements; K, Rb, Ba, Th, U), HFSE (high field strength elements; Ti, P, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta, Y), and HREE (heavy rare-earth elements). Negative Eu anomalies characterize UC of all ages, although they are relatively small in Archean UC. Cratonic shales show the same secular compositional changes as UC with the following important exceptions: At the A/P boundary, only shales show a decrease in Fe, V and Sc and an increase in Na, Ca and Sr, and only UC shows a significant increase in HREE and Y. Although post-Archean UC has a larger Eu anomaly than Archean UC, it is clear that both Archean UC and Archean shales have negative Eu anomalies, and that shales give only a weak indication of an increasing Eu anomaly in UC formed after the Archean. In both UC and shales at the A/P boundary, Cr/Th, Ni/Co and Co/Th ratios decrease, whereas the Th/U ratio increases only in shales and not in UC. The lack of HREE depletion and the high Fe, V and Sc contents of Archean shales indicate these shales were not derived from sources similar in composition to exposed Archean UC. The shale sources, which are now removed by erosion, must have been composed largely of basalt (± komatiite) (60\%) and granite (40\%), with little contribution from HREE-depleted TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite), which now dominates in Archean exposures. This suggests strong vertical zonation in the Archean continents with granites intruded into greenstones at very shallow levels. Compositional changes in UC or/and shales at the A/P boundary can be explained in one of the four ways: (1) a greater amount of basalt and komatiite in Archean UC (high Cr and Ni in Archean UC and shales); (2) garnet/amphibole fractionation during production of TTG by partial melting of hydrous basaltic crust (low HREE and Y in Archean UC); (3) change in TTG magma source from descending slab or thickened crust to metasomatized mantle wedge (increase in LILE and LREE in post-Archean UC and shales); and (4) a decrease in the intensity of chemical weathering after the Archean (increase in Na, Ca and Sr in post-Archean shales).},

There is a lack of any recent attempt in the literature to update the pioneering work of Martin and Meybeck [Martin, J.-M., Meybeck, M., 1979.

Apart from compiling a new database on particulate matter, this paper also aims to give a “snap-shot” of elemental fluxes for each continent. This approach should allow us to obtain new insights on weathering conditions in different environments and assess the influence of human activities on natural geochemical cycles. Finally, this study demonstrates the large uncertainties currently associated with estimating the flux of sediments transported by rivers. By comparing the riverine suspended sediment fluxes of some metals (Cd, Zn, Ni, Cu, Cr and Pb) given in this study with estimates of the anthropogenic fluxes of these metals to the atmosphere, soils and waters (natural ecosystems) [Nriagu, J.O., 1988. A silent epidemic of environmental poisoning. Environ. Pollut. 50, 139–161.], we can see that riverine fluxes are similar to anthropogenic fluxes. This casts light on the effect of human activities on the cycles of trace elements at the Earth's surface.},

Most of these are new analyses from the Gowganda and Serpent Formations (Fig. 2). The remainder are from published sources cited in Fig. 4. The composition of lutites from the Huronian Supergroup records an early period of intense, probably tropical, weathering followed by climatic deterioration that culminated in widespread deposition of glaciogenic sediments of the Gowganda Formation. Climatic amelioration followed during deposition of the succeeding Huronian formations.

	abstract = {An estimate of average river particulate matter (RPM) composition was bàsed on analyses of more than 40 elements in the Amazon, Congo, Ganges, Magdalena, Mekong, Parana and Orinoco rivers, to which were added literature data for 13 other major world rivers, covering the whole spectrum of morphoclimatic features. Geographic variations of major elements in RPM are mostly linked to weathering types and to the balance between weathering rate and river transport. As a result of chemical erosion, Al, Fe and Ti are enriched in RPM with respect to the average parent rock, while Na, Ca, Mg and Sr are strongly depleted. These figures are directly related to the relative importance of dissolved and particulate transport in rivers; this has been computed for each of 40 elements. In order to study weathering on a global scale, the total observed elemental fluxes (dissolved + particulate) have been computed and compared to theoretical ones. The latter were derived from the elemental content in the average parent rock and the total quantity of weathered material, computed from the Al ratio in RPM and in parent rock. Observed and theoretical fluxes are balanced for the less mobilized elements (rare earths, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Mn, Rb, Si, Th, Ti, U and V) for which no enrichment relative to Al is noted in RPM, and for B, Ba, Ca, K, Mg, Na, Sr which are relatively depleted in RPM due to their high dissolved transport. Additional fluxes have been found for Br, Sb, Pb, Cu, Mo, Zn and are possible also for Ni and P. This is reflected by marked enrichments in RPM relative to Al for the poorly or moderately dissolved transports (Pb, Cu, Zn). Several hypotheses involving either the natural origin (volcanic dust, marine aerosols, geochemical fractionation) or the artificial origin (worldwide pollution) are discussed to explain these discrepancies, assuming river transport and weathering either to be in a steady state on a global scale or not. However, none of them can fully account for these additional fluxes. It is most likely that these excesses have multiple origins, anthropogenic or natural or both. The comparison between RPM and deep-sea clay compositions emphasizes the prime influence of river input on oceanic sedimentation of Si, Al, Fe, Ti, lanthanides, Sc, Rb, V, etc. A few elements such as Zn, Sb, occur in excess in RPM as compared to deep-sea clays; in order to balance this excess, a remobilization of these elements out of the sediment can be considered. Finally, the enrichment of Co, Cu, Mn and Ni in deep-sea clays compared to RPM is discussed and attributed to several sources and processes.},

	abstract = {Whether or not steady-state topography and denudation are probable states depends on the timescale of system response to tectonic and climatic perturbations relative to the frequency of those perturbations. This paper presents analytical derivations of algebraic relations for the response time of detachment-limited fluvial bedrock channel systems both to tectonic and climatic perturbations. Detachmentlimited fluvial erosion is described by the stream-power incision model, and the derivations are limited to the applicability of that model. All factors likely to influence system response time that are not adequately captured by the stream-power incision model will tend to increase the response time. The calculations presented thus provide minimum estimates of landscape response time and therefore over-predict the probability of attaining and sustaining steady-state topography and denudation. The Central Range of Taiwan is used as a case study to estimate response times in a landscape often argued to be in steady state. Model parameters are fit to modern stream profiles by assuming that the topography represents a quasi-steady-state form. Estimated response times generally range from 0.25 to 2.5 Ma, depending on the non-linearity of the incision rule and the magnitude and type of perturbation. Thus it may be reasonably argued that steady-state topography and denudation are likely to prevail during periods of climatic stability (response time is sufficiently short compared with plate tectonic timescales). However, rapid climatic fluctuation in the Quaternary appears to preclude the attainment of steady-state conditions in modern orogens.},

	abstract = {Geochemical and Hf–Nd isotope studies of Neoproterozoic sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks in the Nanhua Rift Basin, South China, demonstrate that their source provenances contained large proportions of mafic rocks and various amounts of granites. A significant proportion of the studied Neoproterozoic rift sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks have initial εNd(t) values higher than those of Neoproterozoic granites, but fall within the range of ca. 825–750Ma basaltic rocks. Their initial εNd(t) values correlate with ratios of La/Sc, La/Cr, La/V, La/Co and La/Ni. The Nd isotope and trace element data, in combination with existing in-situ U–Pb and hafnium–oxygen isotope data from the detrital zircon grains indicate a dominant ca. 825–800Ma mafic provenance. Furthermore, the studied samples formed a linear array and plot within the field defined by the remanent of ca. 825–810Ma continental flood basalts in the Hf–Nd isotopic space. Thus, the inferred large proportions of mafic rocks in the source provenance of the Neoproterozoic rift sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks likely signify an eroded continental flood basalt province, similar to that reported for the Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in Australia. This work thus provides further evidence for the possible once existence of a common large igneous province between South China and eastern Australia as adjacent parts of the supercontinent Rodinia.},

The South African glacial deposits (Pakhuis Formation of the Table Mountain Group) are present in the western part of the Cape Fold Belt. Two thin diamictites are succeeded by a coarsening upward shale-siltstone unit known as the Cedarberg Formation. These glaciogenic rocks are associated with one of the world's greatest accumulations of mature sandstones. The diamictites are under- and overlain by shales and sandstones that have undergone extensive alteration, presumably as a result of chemical weathering. Some diamictite samples have low values for a Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), in keeping with their inferred glacial origin. Immediately above the glaciogenic diamictites, black shales, comprising the basal Soom Member of the Cedarberg Formation preserve an unusual soft bodied fauna and are enriched in Mo, U and other trace elements. The unusual chemical composition of these shales is attributed to starved basin conditions and a reducing environment during a rapid sea level rise that accompanied demise of the late Ordovician glaciers. The late Ordovician glacial deposits of western South Africa are widely regarded as the distal deposits of a large continental ice sheet centred on North Africa but they may have been partly derived from piedmont glaciers that descended from highlands formed as a result of late Ordovician orogeny.},

The Tsetserleg terrane consists mainly of clastic sediments, and is situated in the southern Hangay–Hentey Basin. Internally the terrane is divided into the Erdenetsogt (Middle Devonian), Tsetserleg (Middle-Upper Devonian) and Jargalant (Lower Carboniferous) Formations. Provenance and tectonic setting of the Hangay–Hentey Basin remains controversial, with proposals ranging from passive margin through to island-arc. A suite of 94 Tsetserleg sandstones and mudrocks was collected with the aim of constraining provenance, source weathering, and depositional setting, using established petrographic and whole-rock geochemical parameters. Petrographically the sandstones are immature, with average compositions of Q22F14L64, Q14F17L69, and Q18F12L70 in the Erdenetsogt, Tsetserleg, and Jargalant Formations, respectively. Lv/L ratios range from 0.81 to 1.00 (average 0.95), and P/F from 0.68 to 0.93 (average 0.83). Framework compositions indicate deposition in an undissected or transitional arc. Geochemically, the sandstones are classified as greywackes. Geochemical contrasts between sandstone and mudrock averages in each formation are small, with lithotype means for SiO2 ranging only from 65.54 to 68.62 wt.\%. These features and weak trends on variation diagrams reflect the immaturity of the sediments. Comparison of elemental abundances with average upper continental crust, major element discriminant scores, and immobile element ratios indicate a uniform average source composition between dacite and rhyolite. The maximum value for the Chemical Index of Alteration in the Erdenetsogt Formation is about 78 after correction for K-metasomatism, indicating moderate source weathering. Lower maximum values (61 and 63, respectively) in the Tsetserleg and Jargalant Formations indicate they were derived from a virtually unweathered and tectonically active source. Tectonic setting discrimination parameters indicate a continental island-arc environment, similar to several other CAOB suites of similar age. This arc source may have been built on a continental fragment situated within the Mongol–Okhotsk Ocean during Middle Devonian-Lower Carboniferous time.},

	abstract = {The vertical variability in mineralogical, chemical and isotopic compositions observed in large river suspended sediments calls for a depth-integration of this variability to accurately determine riverine geochemical fluxes. In this paper, we present a method to determine depth-integrated chemical particulate fluxes of large rivers, based on river sampling along depth-profiles, and applied to the Amazon Basin lowland tributaries. The suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration data from depth-profiles is modeled for a number of individual grain size fractions using the Rouse model, which allows to predict the grain size distribution of suspended sediment throughout the whole river cross-section. Then, using (1) the relationship between grain size distribution and the Al/Si ratio (2) relationships between the Al/Si ratio and the chemical concentrations, the chemical composition of river sediment is predicted throughout the river cross-section, and integrated to yield the depth-integrated chemical particulate flux for a number of chemical elements (e.g. Si, Al, Fe, Na, REEs,…). For elements such as Al, Fe, REEs, Th, the depth-integrated flux is around twice as high as the one calculated from river surface sample characteristics. For Na and Si, the depth-integrated flux is three times higher than the “surface” estimate, due to the enrichment of albite and quartz at the bottom of the river. Depth-integrated 87Sr/86Sr composition of suspended sediment, also predictable using this method, differs by more than 10−3 from the surface sample composition. Finally, potential implications of depth-integrated estimates of Amazon sediment chemistry are explored. Depth-integration of particulate 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios is necessary for a reliable use of Sr isotopes as a provenance tracer. The concept of steady-state weathering of a large river basin is revisited using depth-integrated sediment composition. This analysis shows that, in the Amazon Basin river, the previously observed discrepancy between (1) weathering intensities of channel surface sediment and (2) silicate-derived dissolved fluxes is only slightly accounted for by the vertical variability of suspended sediment weathering intensities. This observation confirms that most large rivers basins are not eroding at steady-state.},

	abstract = {Major, trace and rare earth element (REE) chemistry of fresh-water lake sediments, stituated in the middle Siwalik Formation (Pliocene), have been investigated. The log (Fe2O3/K2O) vs log (SiO2/Al2O3) plot of sediments discriminate the rock types of the catchment which are remarkably similar to those observed in thinsections. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) between 75.2 to 78.1 and Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) between 79.5 to 89.8 are higher than Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS), indicating moderate to high weathering at source area. The PAAS normalized REE patterns are similar and differentiate the major rock types on the basis of abundance of REEs in accordance to clay minerals, grain size, with the highest concentration in the finest grain sediments. It also indicates poor mixing of sediments. The consistency of REEs in sediments with those of rock types illustrate almost unaltered, unmodified transport of these from the provenance to the detritus deposited in the basin and also shows that the REEs are enriched in phyllosilicates. The major elements, Fe2O3, TiO2, MgO, K2O show strong positive correlation with Al2O3 and follow the trend of the latter, and REEs also indicate same characteristics, hence phyllosilicates are likely to be the promising host for REEs. The negative correlation of La, Yb and Y with Zr and positive correlation with REEs and Al2O3 do not indicate Zr control on REE distribution in the present case. The petrographic character of minerals in thinsection of rocks as well as of lake sediments and low Na2O/K2O ratio in the latter show short distance transport, textural immaturity and sorting of grains. The higher Zr/Th and Zr/Yb ratios in coarser sediments than in fine grain detritus are supporting evidence of sedimentary sorting. Chondrite normalized REE patterns and negative Eu anomaly of the lake sediments are similar to that of PAAS indicating that they may have been originally derived from differentiated silicic (felsic) and/or recycled sedimentary source and deposited in foreland basin. However, petrographic character, REEs and high field strength elements estimated on sediments, tends to support metamorphic source area for middle Siwalik detritus and is consistent to the observations made on rocks exposed in the catchment area, attesting to the rise of Himalaya in phases, exposing fresh rocks for erosion/weathering, lying northward in Lesser Himalayan domain. Plot of sediment chemistry of lakes on tectonic delineation diagrams show that Rewalsar detritus derived from middle Siwalik rocks are from passive margin setting. The discriminant function plots of sediment samples also indicate that they are derived from craton interior or a quartzose sedimentary orogenic terrain and deposited in a passive margin setting. The chemistry of Rewalsar sediments is thus a proxy for the middle Siwalik rocks deposited in the foreland basin and throw light on provenance, source area weathering, and tectonic setting of the source rock.},

We characterize the chemical and isotopic variability of river sediments of the Amazon Basin, collected at different water depths, as a function of grain size. Absolute chemical concentrations and Sr and Nd isotopic ratios greatly varies along channel depth. The Al/Si ratio, tightly linked to grain size distribution, systematically decreases with depth, mostly reflecting dilution by quartz minerals. A double-normalization diagram is proposed to correct from dilution effects. Elements define fan-shaped patterns and can be classified in three different groups with respect to hydrodynamic sorting during transport in the Amazon: (1) “poorly sorted” insoluble elements like Al, Fe, Th, and REEs, (2) “well-sorted” insoluble elements like Zr and Ti, mainly carried by heavy minerals, and (3) alkali (Na to Cs) and alkali-earth elements (Mg to Ba), for which a large variety of patterns is observed, related, for alkali, to their variable affinity for phyllosilicates. Sr isotopes show that the Amazon River at the mouth is stratified, the Madeira- and Solimões-derived sediments being preferentially transported near the channel surface and at depth, respectively. The comparison between the Solimões and Madeira rivers shows how the interplay between grain sorting, weathering, and crustal composition controls the composition of the suspended river sediments.},

Well known for its marked taxonomic diversity and exquisite preservation, the biota inhabited a warm, shallow, epicontinental basin rich in nutrients into which were dispersed clay minerals, from weathering of continental crust, and minor amounts of volcanic detritus. The fossils were preserved by compression in fine-grained smectite–illite–kaolinite mudstones deposited in a sulfur-deficient disoxic and anoxic environment. Subsequently, the long-term (∼1Ga) tectonic stability of the southeast margin of the Siberian platform has provided an exceptional environment for the preservation of the microfossil assemblage without significant diagenetic alteration. Conclusions drawn here from studies of the paleoecology, taphonomy, and diagenesis of the Lakhanda Lagerstätte may provide a globally useful model in the search for additional evidence of the Precambrian rise to dominance of eukaryotes in the Earth's biosphere.},

	abstract = {Located in the uplands of the Valley and Ridge physiographic province of Pennsylvania, the Susquehanna/Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHO) is a tectonically quiescent, first-order catchment developed on shales of the Silurian Rose Hill Formation. We used soil cores augered at the highest point of the watershed and along a subsurface water flowline on a planar hillslope to investigate mineral transformations and physical/chemical weathering fluxes. About 25m of bedrock was also drilled to estimate parent composition. Depletion of carbonate at tens of meters of depth in bedrock may delineate a deep carbonate-weathering front. Overlying this, extending from ∼6m below the bedrock–soil interface up into the soil, is the feldspar dissolution front. In the soils, depletion profiles for K, Mg, Si, Fe, and Al relative to the bedrock define the illite and chlorite reaction fronts. When combined with a cosmogenic nuclide-derived erosion rate on watershed sediments, these depletion profiles are consistent with dissolution rates that are several orders of magnitudes slower for chlorite (1–5×10−17 molm−2 s−1) and illite (2–9×10−17 molm−2 s−1) than observed in the laboratory. Mineral reactions result in formation of vermiculite, hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite, and minor kaolinite. During weathering, exchangeable divalent cations are replaced by Al as soil pH decreases. The losses of Mg and K in the soils occur largely as solute fluxes; in contrast, losses of Al and Fe are mostly as downslope transport of fine particles. Physical erosion of bulk soils also occurs: results from a steady-state model demonstrate that physical erosion accounts for about half of the total denudation at the ridgetop and midslope positions. Chemical weathering losses of Mg, Na, and K are higher in the upslope positions likely because of the higher degree of chemical undersaturation in porewaters. Chemical weathering slows down in the valley floor and Al and Si even show net accumulation. The simplest model for the hillslope that is consistent with all observations is a steady-state, clay weathering-limited system where soil production rates decrease with increasing soil thickness.},

The combination of perturbation and power transformation provides a strong tool for analyzing compositional linear processes in the simplex. When the process is constrained in the sense of a well-known starting (or final) composition, noncentred principal component analysis can be used to estimate the leading perturbation vector of the process. Applying these mathematical tools to chemical major element data from a weathering profile developed on granitoid rocks allows us to model the compositional changes associated with the process of chemical weathering. The comparison of these results with the compositional linear trend defined by erosional products of several of the world's major drainage systems yields close similarities. The latter observation allows for a mathematical formulation of a global mean weathering trend within the system Al2O3–CaO– Na2O– K2O. We further demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for validating processes behind individual trends and for combining the effects of different processes which modify the composition of soils, sediments, and rocks. Alternatives to the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) are discussed to obtain a translation-invariant scale for the process of chemical weathering.},

	abstract = {In hot–humid equatorial climate chemical weathering may be so strong that provenance signatures may be largely lost and even detritus derived from crystalline basement rocks reduced to quartzose sand. We tested this hypothesis in western Uganda, where stable plateau areas contrast with the active tectonic setting of the Albertine Rift (western branch of the East African Rift System, EARS), culminating in the strongly exhumed fault block of the {\textgreater}5000m high Rwenzori Mountains. In this setting, sediments derived from similar types of basement rocks including gneiss, schist, amphibolite, metasediments and granites can be traced from rapidly eroding high-altitude areas to low-altitude areas undergoing prolonged weathering. Sand and mud carried by 51 rivers overall in these two contrasting landscapes were sampled to study how and to what extent detrital modes are modified by the selective loss of unstable detrital minerals. Sediments generated in the high-relief Rwenzori Mountains show abundant feldspar (up to 32\%) and rock fragments (up to 52\%), which together with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio and composition close to the Upper Continental Crust (UCC standard) reflect erosion in weathering-limited conditions. In the central Rwenzoris, low Th/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios, weak negative Eu anomaly, lower LaN/YbN values, and heavy-mineral assemblages with hornblende and epidote reflect the lithology of source rocks in the Buganda-Toro-Greenstone Belt. In contrast, sediments produced on the low-relief plateau have quartz content up to 98\% and higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratio. Systematic loss of mobile elements is indicated by high chemical weathering indices CIA, PIA and WIP. However, provenance from metamorphic basement rocks is still indicated by heavy-mineral assemblages dominated by epidote and amphibole, whereas provenance from granitic rocks is revealed by high Th/Sc and Zr/Sc ratio, negative Eu anomaly and higher LaN/YbN values. We conclude that first-cycle sediments generated in high-relief areas preserve the original imprint of parent lithologies even in very humid equatorial climate. In low-relief areas, although weathering processes have proceeded over millions of years turning basement-derived detritus into an almost pure quartzose resistate, provenance signals are not erased entirely, and can be still retrieved from the residual heavy-mineral suite and relative abundance of high-field-strength trace elements.},

	abstract = {This study presents an integrated mineralogical–geochemical database on fine-grained sediments transported by all major rivers of southern Africa, including the Zambezi, Okavango, Limpopo, Olifants, Orange and Kunene. Clay mineralogy, bulk geochemistry, Sr and Nd isotopic signatures of river mud, considered a proxy of suspended load, are used to investigate the influence of source-rock lithology and weathering intensity on the composition of clay and silt produced in subequatorial to subtropical latitudes. Depletion in mobile alkali and alkaline-earth metals, minor in arid Namibia, is strong in the Okavango, Kwando and Upper Zambezi catchments, where recycling is also extensive. Element removal is most significant for Na, and to a lesser extent for Sr. Depletion in K, Ca and other elements, negligible in Namibia, is moderate elsewhere. The most widespread clay minerals are smectite, dominant in muds derived from Karoo or Etendeka flood basalts, or illite and chlorite, dominant in muds derived from metasedimentary rocks of the Damara Orogen or Zimbabwe Craton. Kaolinite represents 30–40\% of clay minerals only in Okavango and Upper Zambezi sediments sourced in humid subequatorial Angola and Zambia. After subtracting the effects of recycling and of local accumulation of authigenic carbonates in soils, the regional distribution of clay minerals and chemical indices consistently reflect weathering intensity primarily controlled by climate. Bulk geochemistry identifies most clearly volcaniclastic sediments and mafic sources in general, but cannot discriminate the other sources of detritus in detail. Instead, Sr and Nd isotopic fingerprints are insensitive to weathering, and thus mirror faithfully the tectonic structure of the southern African continent. Isotopic tools thus represent a much firmer basis than bulk geochemistry or clay mineralogy in the provenance study of mudrocks.},

	abstract = {An overview of quantitative approaches to analysis and modelling of sediment generation and provenance is presented, with an emphasis on major framework components as determined by means of petrographic techniques. Conceptual models of sediment provenance are shown to be consistent with two classes of numerical–statistical models, i.e. linear mixing models and compositional linear models. These cannot be placed within a common mathematical framework, because the former requires that sediment composition is expressed in terms of proportions, whereas the latter requires that sediment composition is expressed in terms of log-ratios of proportions. Additivity of proportions, a fundamental assumption in linear mixing models, cannot be readily expressed in log-ratio terms. Linear mixing models may be used to describe compositional variability in terms of physical and conceptual (un)mixing. Models of physical (un)mixing are appropriate for describing compositional variation within transport-invariant subpopulations of grains as a result of varying rates of supply of detritus from multiple sources. Conceptual (un)mixing governs the relations among chemical, mineralogical and petrographic characteristics of sediments, which represent different descriptive levels within a compositional hierarchy. Compositional linear process models may be used to describe compositional and/or textural evolution resulting from selective modifications induced by sediment transport, as well as chemical and mechanical weathering. Current approaches to modelling of surface processes treat the coupled evolution of source areas and sedimentary basins in terms of bulk mass transfer only, and do not take into account compositional and textural sediment properties. Moving from the inverse modelling approach embodied in provenance research to process-based forward models of sediment generation which provide detailed predictions of sediment properties meets with considerable (albeit not insurmountable) problems. Strategies for developing more advanced parameterizations of sediment properties and for simulating their evolution are proposed, and expansion of current data-acquisition protocols is discussed in the light of data requirements for such advanced sediment-generation models. Inclusion of sediment-generation modules in models of landscape evolution and basin filling will mark a significant step towards full-fledged “source-to-sink” simulations of earth-surface processes.},

Down-core trends in mineral abundance suggest that plagioclase feldspars and other reactive silicate phases (olivine, pyroxene, volcanic ash) are transformed into smectite in the methanogenic sediment sections. The element ratios Na/Al, Mg/Al, and Ca/Al in the solid phase decrease with sediment depth indicating a loss of mobile cations with depth and producing a significant down-core increase in the chemical index of alteration. Pore waters separated from the sediment cores are highly enriched in dissolved magnesium, total alkalinity, humic substances, and boron. The high contents of dissolved organic carbon in the deeper methanogenic sediment sections (50–150mgdm−3) may promote the dissolution of silicate phases through complexation of Al3+ and other structure-building cations. A non-steady state transport-reaction model was developed and applied to evaluate the down-core trends observed in the solid and dissolved phases. Dissolved Mg and total alkalinity were used to track the in-situ rates of marine silicate weathering since thermodynamic equilibrium calculations showed that these tracers are not affected by ion exchange processes with sediment surfaces. The modeling showed that silicate weathering is limited to the deeper methanogenic sediment section whereas reverse weathering was the dominant process in the overlying surface sediments. Depth-integrated rates of marine silicate weathering in methanogenic sediments derived from the model (81.4–99.2mmol CO2m−2year−1) are lower than the marine weathering rates calculated from the solid phase data (198–245mmol CO2m−2year−1) suggesting a decrease in marine weathering over time. The production of CO2 through reverse weathering in surface sediments (4.22–15.0mmol CO2m−2year−1) is about one order of magnitude smaller than the weathering-induced CO2 consumption in the underlying sediments. The evaluation of pore water data from other continental margin sites shows that silicate weathering is a common process in methanogenic sediments. The global rate of CO2 consumption through marine silicate weathering estimated here as 5–20Tmol CO2year−1 is as high as the global rate of continental silicate weathering.},

	abstract = {Trends in compositional diagrams are frequently used to describe and interpret the imprint of certain processes on sediment composition. Most of these trends are intuitive and “hand-drawn”, although a numerical description of compositional changes involved with these processes would allow for a quantitative assessment of the observed sediment compositions and the proposed processes. This paper suggests a statistical approach to model compositional linear trends, which allows for a mathematically rigorous description of changes in sediment composition related to a specific process or a combination of processes. Three case studies dealing with different aspects of the sedimentary cycle demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. In the first example, a modelled average global chemical weathering trend is used to calculate an appropriate measure for the degree of chemical weathering of the suspended load from some of the world's major rivers. In the second example, data on precipitation and relief from different watersheds are quantitatively related to the petrographic composition of fine-grained sands from low-order streams derived from these watersheds. The third example is an attempt to quantify the interdependence of chemical sediment composition and grain size in the absence of chemical weathering. Superposition of individual compositional linear trends allows for modelling sediment composition in more complicated case studies. Although primarily a forward modelling approach, it can be also used inversely, and, therefore, has strong potential for tracing back the sediment-forming processes in order to reconstruct the original source rocks of the sediment.},

The British Geological Survey's Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment (G-BASE) project provides one such source of data: national coverage of stream sediment, stream water and soil geochemistry. While this geochemical data is of obvious benefit to our understanding of the present day surface environment, the rich geological diversity of south west England provides an ideal setting in which to showcase the potential of such data to enhance our understanding of the underlying bedrock. In this paper we use compositional data analysis to extract lithostratigraphic information from G-BASE stream sediment data. We find that variations in G-BASE stream sediment geochemistry correspond very closely to mapped variations in bedrock geology. Geochemical variations between the 16 lithostratigraphic domains into which we classify the region provide insight into the distinct geological histories of the lithologies within each domain, particularly in relation to depositional environments and sediment provenance.},

	abstract = {Understanding the controls on chemical weathering, especially of silicate minerals, remains a major challenge, despite its importance in controlling the evolution of the Earth’s surface. In particular, it has proved hard to distinguish the temperature sensitivity of silicate weathering rates from other factors. Here we present a new compilation of chemical and physical erosion rates in small catchments and show that silicate weathering rates are not governed by any single parameter but require consideration in multiple dimensions. The overall variation in silicate weathering rates with physical erosion rates, rainfall, and temperature can be quantitatively described by a parameterization based on considering their limiting relationships. At lower erosion rates mineral supply limits weathering. At higher erosion rates there is abundant material but kinetic and therefore climatic factors limit weathering. A predictive model describing the field data based on transport and weathering (kinetically) limited scenarios yields theoretically sensible values for fitted parameters. In the transport-limited case, the supply of silicate cations from weathering is directly proportional to the supply of material by erosion, consistent with complete leaching of cations from fresh regolith. In the kinetically limited case, weathering scales directly with runoff, as the square root of erosion rate, and with an activation energy of 74 F 29 kJ/mol, consistent with expected values in the Earth’s surface settings.

Though clearly demonstrated by well-controlled laboratory dissolution experiments, the temperature dependence of silicate weathering rates, hypothesized to play a central role in these weathering feedbacks, has been difficult to quantify clearly in natural settings at landscape scale. By compiling data from basaltic catchments worldwide and considering only inactive volcanic fields (IVFs), here we show that the rate of CO2 consumption associated with the weathering of basaltic rocks is strongly correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT) as predicted by chemical kinetics. Relations between temperature and CO2 consumption rate for active volcanic fields (AVFs) are complicated by other factors such as eruption age, hydrothermal activity, and hydrological complexities. On the basis of this updated data compilation we are not able to distinguish whether or not there is a significant runoff control on basalt weathering rates. Nonetheless, the simple temperature control as observed in this global dataset implies that basalt weathering could be an effective mechanism for Earth to modulate long-term carbon cycle perturbations.},

	abstract = {River particulates have been collected from twenty-three rivers from throughout the continental USA. The rivers drain mostly large basins (basin areas range from 2.1 x 10(3) to 2970 x 10(3) km2) composed of mixed lithologies, and spanning a wide range of climatic conditions as evidenced by a large variation in air and ground water temperatures, precipitation, and runoff. Suspended particulates have been analyzed for organic and inorganic carbon, as well as the major elements Al, Fe, Mn, K, Si, Ca, Mg, and Na. Also determined were suspended sediment loads at the time of sampling, particle surface areas, and grain size distributions. Five-year average river water chemistry and suspended sediment concentrations, obtained from USGS water supply reports, are also included as supporting information. Particle chemistry systematically varies with rates of runoff, with high runoff rivers transporting the most heavily altered particulates and low runoff rivers carrying the least altered. Degrees of alteration are indicated by the extent to which the refractory, nonmobile elements Al and Fe are concentrated into the particulates and the extent to which the most easily weathered elements Na, Ca, and Mg have been leached. Overall, the susceptibility of elements towards leaching is consistent with numerous previous descriptions of element mobility on weathering. A simple predictive model has been developed to explore and explain the observed trends between particle composition and river runoff. Thus, the elemental composition of riverine particulates may be given by the expression PCOi = [(Propi)TM-DCOi]/SS, where PCOi is the concentration of element i (as the oxide) in a riverine particulate, Propi is the proportion of i (as the oxide) in unweathered rock, DCOi is the dissolved concentration of i (as the equivalent oxide), TM is the total rock derived mass dissolved in river water, and SS is suspended sediment concentration. To utilize this equation, a model was first developed to predict the concentration of river solutes with the input of temperature, precipitation, and a limited number of weathering parameters. Combining this solute model with the above predictive equation for particle composition, it was discovered that the observed trends between particle composition and runoff require the special circumstance of decreasing SS with increasing runoff. Hence, the composition of river particulates depends both on the climate parameters of runoff and temperature (as they control dissolved river chemistry) and the nonclimate parameters including elevation, relief, tectonics, and basin area that control the SS load of rivers.},

Six lithofacies were recognised in the glacials which have a maximum thickness in excess of 100 m. The diamictite facies is subdivided in a massive homogeneous, a faintly bedded homogeneous, a laminated and a bedded heterogeneous subfacies, which respectively represent basal till, proximal and distal waterlain tills and reworked till. The conglomerate, sandstone, sandstone—siltstone—shale and sandstone—carbonate facies were formed by glacial outwash and minor deltaic and beach sedimentation. Mud with ice-rafted debris constitutes the varved mudstone facies, while the dark shale facies consists of post-glacial shallow-water beds. The palaeotopography, clast characteristics, sedimentary facies and small-scale erosional features were applied to determined the direction of ice flow and to establish a four-stage model for the glaciation. During the valley glaciation stage ice flowed southwards down the Ghaap escarpment, largely modifying the pre-glacial erosional features. This was followed by an ice-sheet stage with the spreading centre of the ice over the Transvaal Highlands. During its main phase the ice selectively eroded the area depending on the basal thermal regime. With deglaciation, basal till was deposited by grounded ice, but as the ice became buoyant, initially proximal and later distal waterlain tills were deposited. These two stages represent the Older glaciation terminated by the retreat of the ice and a subsequent uplift of the area. The Younger glaciation started also in the north with a minor valley glaciation stage during which lodgement tills, glacial outwash, deltaic beds and beach sediments were deposited. This was followed by a marine transgression and finally an ice-shelf stage when ice flowed down the Ghaap escarpment into the embayment formed by the Prieska Basin. Deposition of proximal and distal waterlain tills by basal melt-out took place. Varved sediments with minor ice-rafted debris locally overlying the tills represent the final retreat of the ice.},

	abstract = {Differential rates of plagioclase and K-feldspar weathering commonly observed in bedrock and soil environments are examined in terms of chemical kinetic and solubility controls and hydrologic permeability. For the Panola regolith, in the Georgia Piedmont Province of southeastern United States, petrographic observations, coupled with elemental balances and 87Sr/86Sr ratios, indicate that plagioclase is being converted to kaolinite at depths {\textgreater} 6 m in the granitic bedrock. K-feldspar remains pristine in the bedrock but subsequently weathers to kaolinite at the overlying saprolite. In contrast, both plagioclase and K-feldspar remain stable in granitic bedrocks elsewhere in Piedmont Province, such as Davis Run, Virginia, where feldspars weather concurrently in an overlying thick saprolite sequence. Kinetic rate constants, mineral surface areas, and secondary hydraulic conductivities are fitted to feldspar losses with depth in the Panola and Davis Run regoliths using a time-depth computer spreadsheet model. The primary hydraulic conductivities, describing the rates of meteoric water penetration into the pristine granites, are assumed to be equal to the propagation rates of weathering fronts, which, based on cosmogenic isotope dating, are 7 m/106 yr for the Panola regolith and 4 m/106 yr for the Davis Run regolith. Best fits in the calculations indicate that the kinetic rate constants for plagioclase in both regoliths are factors of two to three times faster than K-feldspar, which is in agreement with experimental findings. However, the range for plagioclase and K-feldspar rates (kr = 1.5 × 10−17 to 2.8 × 10−16 mol m−2 s−1) is three to four orders of magnitude lower than for that for experimental feldspar dissolution rates and are among the slowest yet recorded for natural feldspar weathering. Such slow rates are attributed to the relatively old geomorphic ages of the Panola and Davis Run regoliths, implying that mineral surface reactivity decreases significantly with time. Differential feldspar weathering in the low-permeability Panola bedrock environment is more dependent on relative feldspar solubilities than on differences in kinetic reaction rates. Such weathering is very sensitive to primary and secondary hydraulic conductivities (qp and qs), which control both the fluid volumes passing through the regolith and the thermodynamic saturation of the feldspars. Bedrock permeability is primarily intragranular and is created by internal weathering of networks of interconnected plagioclase phenocrysts. Saprolite permeability is principally intergranular and is the result of dissolution of silicate phases during isovolumetric weathering. A secondary to primary hydraulic conductivity ratio of qs/qp = 150 in the Panola bedrock results in kinetically controlled plagioclase dissolution but thermodynamically inhibited K-feldspar reaction. This result is in accord with calculated chemical saturation states for groundwater sampled in the Panola Granite. In contrast, greater secondary conductivities in the Davis Run saprolite, qs/qp = 800, produces both kinetically controlled plagioclase and K-feldspar dissolution. Faster plagioclase reaction, leading to bedrock weathering in the Panola Granite but not at Davis Run, is attributed to a higher anorthite component of the plagioclase and a wetter and warmer climate. In addition, the Panola Granite has an abnormally high content of disseminated calcite, the dissolution of which precedes the plagioclase weathering front, thus creating additional secondary permeability.},

	abstract = {Precambrian paleosols are potentially one of our best sources of information about the composition of the atmosphere early in earth's history. To be used this way, however, an alteration profile must be shown to be an in situ product of vadose processes. Data from modern soils show that the ratios of less mobile elements such as Zr, Ti, and Al can be used as a preliminary screen to test for the in situ nature of a profile. If the Ti/Zr ratio departs from that of the host rock by more than 40\%, or the Ti/Al ratio departs by more than 50\% for moderate degrees of weathering, then a significant allochthonous contribution to the profile is indicated. This technique correctly separates in-place from allochthonous horizons when applied to independent data from two modern profiles. A review of published Precambrian profiles identifies two often-cited examples, Denison and Pronto, as suspect based on these criteria. In the interpretation of paleoatmospheres, it is also necessary to show that Fe is controlled not by diagenetic but by pedogenic processes. Comparison of the distribution of Fe to that of Ti and Zr shows that Fe is generally leached from confirmed paleosols older than 2.2 Ga, but is retained in modern soils and in younger paleosols. Reducing conditions developed during diagenesis can, however, produce a removal of Fe in modern alteration profiles that is very difficult to distinguish from removal by soil processes under a low-oxygen atmosphere. Diagenetic and pedogenic Fe removal can possibly be distinguished by the presence of a vertical zonation with a lower zone of Fe enrichment in the pedogenic case.},

However, how the continental crust formed and evolved through time remains highly controversial3,4. In particular, the composition and thickness of juvenile continental crust are unknown. Here we show that Rb/Sr ratios can be used as a proxy for both the silica content and the thickness of the continental crust. We calculate Rb/Sr ratios of the juvenile crust for over 13,000 samples, with Nd model ages ranging from the Hadean to Phanerozoic. The ratios were calculated based on the evolution of Sr isotopes in the period between the TDM Nd model age and the crystallization of the samples analysed. We find that the juvenile crust had a low silica content and was largely mafic in composition during the first 1.5 billion years of Earth’s evolution, consistent with magmatism on a pre-plate tectonics planet. About 3 billion years ago, the Rb/Sr ratios of the juvenile continental crust increased, indicating that the newly formed crust became more silica-rich and probably thicker. This transition is in turn linked to the onset of plate tectonics5 and an increase of continental detritus into the oceans6.},

	abstract = {A multidisciplinary approach is used to analyze the Cenozoic uplift history of South America. Residual depth anomalies of oceanic crust abutting this continent help to determine the pattern of present-day dynamic topography. Admittance analysis and crustal thickness measurements indicate that the elastic thickness of the Borborema and Altiplano regions is km with evidence for sub-plate support at longer wavelengths. A drainage inventory of 1827 river profiles is assembled and used to investigate landscape development. Linear inverse modeling enables river profiles to be fitted as a function of the spatial and temporal history of regional uplift. Erosional parameters are calibrated using observations from the Borborema Plateau and tested against continent-wide stratigraphic and thermochronologic constraints. Our results predict that two phases of regional uplift of the Altiplano plateau occurred in Neogene times. Regional uplift of the southern Patagonian Andes also appears to have occurred in Early Miocene times. The consistency between observed and predicted histories for the Borborema, Altiplano, and Patagonian plateaux implies that drainage networks record coherent signals that are amenable to simple modeling strategies. Finally, the predicted pattern of incision across the Amazon catchment constrains solid sedimentary flux at the Foz do Amazonas. Observed and calculated flux estimates match, suggesting that erosion and deposition were triggered by regional Andean uplift during Miocene times.},

	abstract = {Secular cooling of the Earth is required by surface heat loss and declining radiogenic heat production over the last 4.5 billion years. Igneous geochemistry has been used to understand how changing heat flux influenced Archean geodynamics, but records of systematic geochemical evolution are complicated by heterogeneity of the rock record and uncertainties regarding selection and preservation bias. We apply statistical sampling techniques to a geochemical database of {\textasciitilde}70,000 samples from the continental  igneous rock record to produce the first comprehensive record of secular geochemical evolution throughout Earth history. Consistent with secular mantle cooling, compatible and incompatible elements in basalts record gradually decreasing mantle melt fraction through time. Superimposed on this gradual evolution is a pervasive geochemical discontinuity ca. 2.5 Ga, including dramatic decreases in mantle melt fraction in basalts, and in deep crustal melting/fractionation indicators such as Na/K, Eu/Eu*, and La/Yb of felsic rocks. Along with increased preserved crustal thickness across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary, these data are consistent with a model where high degree Archean mantle melting produced a thick, mafic lower crust and consequent deep crustal delamination and anatexis – in turn resulting in abundant tonalite-tronhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) magmatism and a thin preserved Archean crust. Coincidence of the observed changes in geochemistry and crustal thickness with stepwise atmospheric oxidation  at the end of the Archean provides the most significant temporal link between deep earth geochemical processes and the rise of atmospheric oxygen on Earth.},

	abstract = {The Upper Jurassic Tordillo Formation is exposed along the western edge of the Neuquén Basin (west central Argentina) and consists of fluvial strata deposited under arid/semiarid conditions. The pebble composition of conglomerates, mineralogical composition of sandstones and pelitic rocks, and major- and trace-element geochemistry of sandstones, mudstones, and primary pyroclastic deposits are evaluated to determine the provenance and tectonic setting of the sedimentary basin. Conglomerates and sandstones derived almost exclusively from volcanic sources. The stratigraphic sections to the south show a clast population of conglomerates dominated by silicic volcanic fragments and a predominance of feldspathic litharenites. This framework composition records erosion of Triassic–Jurassic synrift volcaniclastic rocks and basement rocks from the Huincul arch, which was exhumed as a result of Late Jurassic inversion. In the northwestern part of the study area, conglomerates show a large proportion of mafic and acidic volcanic rock fragments, and sandstones are characterised by a high content of mafic volcanic rock fragments and plagioclase. These data suggest that the source of the sandstones and conglomerates was primarily the Andean magmatic arc, located west of the Neuquén Basin. The clay mineral assemblage is interpreted as the result of a complex set of factors, including source rock, climate, transport, and diagenesis. Postdepositional processes produced significant variations in the original compositions, especially the fine-grained deposits. The Tordillo sediments are characterised by moderate SiO2 contents, variable abundances of K2O and Na2O, and a relatively high proportion of ferromagnesian elements. The degree of chemical weathering in the source area, expressed as the chemical index of alteration, is low to moderate. The major element geochemistry and Th/Sc, K/Rb, Co/Th, La/Sc, and Cr/Th values point to a significant input of detrital volcanic material of calcalkaline felsic and intermediate composition. However, major element geochemistry is not useful for interpreting the tectonic setting. Discrimination plots based on immobile trace elements, such as Ti, Zr, La, Sc, and Th, show that most data lie in the active continental margin field. Geochemical information is not sufficiently sensitive to differentiate the two different source areas recognized by petrographic and modal analyses of conglomerates and sandstones.
Resumen
La Formación Tordillo (Jurásico Superior) aflora a lo largo del flanco oeste de la Cuenca Neuquina (Argentina centro occidental) y se caracteriza por depósitos fluviales formados bajo condiciones áridas/semiáridas. Se analiza la composición de los clastos de los conglomerados, la del esqueleto clástico de las areniscas y la de las rocas pelíticas, así como la geoquímica de elementos mayores y vestigios de areniscas, pelitas y sedimentitas piroclásticas primarias. Esta información ha sido evaluada con el objeto de determinar la procedencia y el ambiente tectónico de la cuenca sedimentaria. Los conglomerados y las areniscas derivan casi exclusivamente de áreas de aporte volcánicas. Las secciones estratigráficas ubicadas hacia el sur poseen una población clástica en los conglomerados que está dominada por fragmentos volcánicos silíceos, mientras que entre las areniscas prevalecen las litarenitas feldespáticas. Estos atributos composicionales reflejan la erosión de rocas volcaniclásticas triásico-jurásicas del sinrift de la Cuenca Neuquina y de rocas del basamento procedentes de la Dorsal de Huincul que fueron exhumadas durante el proceso de inversión tectónica ocurrido durante el Jurásico Superior. Hacia el noroeste, los conglomerados se componen de altas proporciones de fragmentos de volcanitas máficas y ácidas, y las areniscas se caracterizan por un alto contenido de fragmentos volcánicos básicos y cristaloclastos de plagioclasa. Estos datos sugieren que el área fuente de las sedimentitas era el arco magmático andino que se ubicaba hacia el oeste de la Cuenca Neuquina. La asociación de argilominerales se interpreta como el resultado de la combinación de un conjunto de factores, tales como roca madre, clima, transporte y diagénesis. Los procesos postdeposicionales han producido cambios significativos con respecto a la composición original de estos minerales. Los sedimentos de la Formación Tordillo poseen contenidos moderados de SiO2, abundancias variables de K2O y Na2O, y una proporción relativamente elevada de elementos ferromagnésicos. El grado de alteración química, expresado por el CIA, fue bajo a moderado. La geoquímica de elementos mayoritarios y las relaciones Th/Sc, K/Rb, Co/Th, La/Sc y Cr/Th indican una significativa contribución de material volcánico calcoalcalino de composición félsica a intermedia. Sin embargo, la geoquímica de elementos mayoritarios no ha resultado de utilidad para interpretar el ambiente tectónico. Los diagramas de discriminación basados en elementos vestigios, tales como Ti, Zr, La, Sc y Th, muestran que los datos se ubican en los campos correspondientes a margen continental activo. A pesar de ello, la información geoquímica no ha sido lo suficientemente sensible como para diferenciar las dos distintas áreas de procedencia reconocidas mediante los estudios composicionales y modales de los conglomerados y las areniscas.},

	abstract = {Samples from strata spanning the Triassic–Jurassic boundary at the GSSP at Kuhjoch and at Kendlbachgraben were studied by NAA, XRF and combustion analysis to determine Ir levels and associated geochemistry. The results are compared to previously determined carbon isotope stratigraphy at these sections. Ir concentrations in the limestones of the Kössen Formation at Kuhjoch are very low ({\textless}10pg/g) below the top of the formation, rising to 26pg/g, in the T-bed at the top of the Eiberg Member. The Tiefengraben Member of the Kendlbach Formation exhibits higher concentrations of Ir in general relative to the strata below. The shift to higher levels is abrupt at the base of the member, coinciding with a decrease in carbonate content. Concentrations of 60 to 80pg/g are typical through the entire thickness of the Schattwald Beds and into the gray Tiefengraben Member strata, peaking at 145pg/g. Concentrations decline to 30–40pg/g above 680cm from the formation base, coinciding with increasing carbonate content. The analyses from the Kendlbachgraben section compare well with those from Kuhjoch, with similar difference in Ir concentration between the Kössen and Kendlbach formations. In both sections, the initial increase in Ir corresponds to the initial carbon isotope excursion. Concentrations of redox-sensitive elements indicate transient reducing conditions during deposition of the uppermost Kössen Formation, but oxidizing conditions during Tiefengraben Member deposition. The Al/Ti ratio indicates more intense weathering during deposition of the lowermost 20cm of the Tiefengraben Member, but otherwise consistently humid to sub-humid climate prevailed during deposition. The primary control on Ir concentration in the sampled section is formation lithology, although there are variations within the Tiefengraben Member that are independent of carbonate content. Enrichment of Ir at the top of the T-bed is associated with a redox boundary, but the cause of other variations is undetermined.},

	abstract = {Sandstone petrography and mudstone mineralogy and geochemistry of Triassic mudstones and sandstones from continental redbeds of the Malaguide Complex (Betic Cordillera, southern Spain) provide useful information on provenance, palaeoclimate and geodynamics during the early stages of the Pangea break-up, and on their diagenetic evolution. The sandstones are quartzarenites to sub-litharenites, with minor lithic fragments and rare feldspars. The mudstone samples show a PAAS like elemental distribution. The samples likely record recycling processes from their metasedimentary basement rocks that significantly affected the weathering indices, and monitors cumulative effects, including a first cycle of weathering at the source rocks. Sandstone composition and chemical–mineralogical features of mudstones record a provenance derived from continental block and recycled orogen that were weathered under warm and episodically wet climate. Source areas were located towards the east of the present-day Malaguide outcrops, and were formed by fairly silicic rock types, made up mainly of Palaezoic metasedimentary rocks, similar to those of the Paleozoic underlying series, with subordinate contributions from magmatic–metamorphic sources, and a rare supply from mafic metavolcanic rocks. Clay-mineral distribution of mudstones is dominated by illite and illite/smectite mixed-layer that result from differences in provenance, weathering, and burial/temperature history. Illite crystallinity values, illitization of kaolinite, occurrence of typical authigenic minerals and apatite fission-track studies, coupled with a subsidence analysis of the whole Malaguide succession suggest burial depths of at least 4–6km with temperatures of 140–160°C, typical of the burial diagenetic stage, and confirm the Middle Miocene exhumation of the Betic Internal Domain tectonic stack topped by the Malaguide Complex.},

	abstract = {Major, trace, and rare earth element abundances were determined for the southwestern Japanese pelagic chert sequence from the early Late Permian to early Early Triassic to investigate a redox change in deep-sea pelagic environments before and at the Permo–Triassic boundary (PTB) (251 Ma). The sequence was primarily deposited in the deep-sea of the superocean Panthalassa, and then was accreted to Japan in the Middle Jurassic. A remarkable lithostratigraphic change from red chert to siliceous∼carbonaceous claystone through gray chert is observed in this sequence. Constituent elements for these sedimentary rocks are essentially derived from two sources: (1) an ancient seawater via biogenic (mainly radiolarian), hydrothermal, and authigenic materials and (2) an average shale-like terrigenous material. The present measurement demonstrates significant stratigraphic changes of the Ce/Cenon-ter* value (estimated Ce anomaly value of non-terrigenous component, recalculated by subtraction of terrigenous REEs from bulk REEs) and the (Mn/TE)sample/(Mn/TE)PAAS value (excess Mn component other than terrigenous one; TE=terrigenous elements including Ti, Al, Nb, Hf, Th; PAAS=Post-Archean Average Australian Shale) in the Permian chert. The Ce/Cenon-ter* values increase from {\textless}0.2 to 1 and the (Mn/TE)sample/(Mn/TE)PAAS values decrease up-section, suggesting that the redox condition of deep-sea open-ocean changed from oxic to suboxic in an interval of approximately 10 Myr. The (∑Fe/TE)sample/(∑Fe/TE)PAAS and (Mn/TE)sample/(Mn/TE)PAAS values of carbonaceous claystone near or at the PTB are less than unity, suggesting that reductive dissolution of iron and manganese occurred under an anoxic condition. This supports the idea of the PTB oceanic anoxia in the superocean Panthalassa. The present data suggest that the anoxic condition prevailed in the deep-sea pelagic regions for an extremely long period, much more than 10 Myr, from the middle Late Permian to early Early Triassic. This long-term development of widespread oceanic anoxia may have been linked to the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic.},

Geochemical data indicate that the clastic rocks of the mélange were derived from continental island arc and continental margin settings, which correspond to felsic volcanic rocks within the Sukhothai Zone and quartz-rich fragments within the Indochina Block, respectively. The results of a mixing model indicate the source rocks were approximately 35\% volcanic rocks of the Sukhothai Zone and 65\% craton sandstone and upper continental crust of the Indochina Block. In contrast, Carboniferous quartzose sedimentary rocks within the Sibumasu Block originated from a continental margin, without a contribution from volcanic rocks. In terms of Paleo-Tethys subduction, a continental island arc in the Sukhothai Zone evolved in tandem with Late Permian–Triassic forearc basins and volcanic activity during the Middle–early Late Triassic. The accretionary complex formed contemporaneously with the evolution of continental island arc during the Permo–Triassic, supplied with sediment from the Sukhothai Zone and the Indochina Block.},

	abstract = {In order to clarify the redox history of the central Panthalassic Ocean in the Middle Triassic (Anisian) to Early Jurassic (Toarcian), we determined the abundances of major, trace and rare earth elements, and organic carbon and total nitrogen isotopes from well-exposed shales interbedded with deep-sea cherts from Inuyama, southwest Japan. A distinct positive Ce anomaly accompanying high Mn and weak Mo enrichments was detected in the transitional sequence across the Tr–J boundary, which indicates deposition under a more oxic condition than at any other period in the study section. The oxic period lasted for 130–170kyr, and coincided with a faunal turnover at the end of the Triassic. On the other hand, strong enrichments of U, V, Mo, TOC and TN in Anisian and Toarcian black shales suggest deep ocean anoxia in both intervals. Highly concentrated Mo contents in some black shales indicate euxinia in the pelagic Panthalassic deep ocean. δ15NTN values are low, down to −2.0‰, in such black shales enriched in redox-sensitive elements, compared with other shales. This low δ15NTN values during recurrent oceanic euxinic events in the Anisian may indicate strong assimilation of ammonium, but the possibility of enhanced nitrogen fixation cannot be ruled out especially for the Toarcian anoxic event. This work provides the first documentation of the long-term redox history in the pelagic Panthalassic deep ocean, from the Middle Triassic to the Early Jurassic, based on redox-sensitive elements in shales, and it reveals probable links between oceanic redox changes and biological activity.},

	abstract = {The trace and minor element and Re–Os geochemistry of the Upper Devonian Woodford Shale are analyzed in order to characterize elemental abundances, to identify associations among trace elements and to constrain paleoceanographic conditions and depositional processes. This organic-carbon-rich mudstone in the Permian Basin, west Texas, is a major source of hydrocarbons in the basin and is coeval with many other Upper Devonian shales in North America. The Woodford lacks enrichment in many trace metals. Only Mo, U, S and Se are significantly enriched. Other redox sensitive elements are depleted or similar to average shale composition, including Pb, Bi, Cr, Ti, Cu, Zn, Co, and V. Elements associated with granitic sources such as rare earths, Th, Ce, and TiO2 are also depleted relative to average shale; this appears to be related to be a source control. A strong basin reservoir effect is noted among several redox sensitive elements, including Mo, Cu and Ni, which largely accounts for the depletion. Dilution by biogenic silica had an additional effect on metal concentrations. Multivariate factors analysis identified associations between elements, including groupings of: rare earth elements; elements enriched in granitic crust; silica, varying antithetically with elements in carbonate minerals; organic carbon, Mo and U; V; phosphate; Fe and S. Noteworthy among the results are the different behavior of redox-sensitive elements, suggesting different precipitation mechanisms or varying dependence on reservoir effects. A strong redox effect is noted in the TOC/Ptot ratio at approximately the Frasnian–Famennian boundary, indicating an abrupt transition to an anoxic column boundary that coincides with a short-term significant fall in sea level. This suggests that anoxia was induced by isolation of the basin from the global ocean. However with the exception of the uppermost Famennian, initial 187Os/188Os values determined from Re–Os geochronology for the Permian Basin are similar to correlative sections of the Appalachian and Peace River Basins of North American and the Rhenohercynian basin of Europe. This indicates that although the Permian Basin became restricted during the upper Devonian and early Mississippian, ocean connectivity remained between regional and global basins.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a geochemical study on the major and trace elements and Pb–Sr isotopes of a weathering profile developed in the Lower Cambrian black shales in central Hunan (China). Six weathering horizons were identified and sampled vertically throughout the profile. The chemical composition of the profile consists of variable concentrations of the major elements Fe2O3, FeO, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, and P2O5 and of less variable concentrations of SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, and K2O. The chemical change caused by weathering is estimated by mass-balance calculations, and the results show that the element mobility is characterised by substantial loss of SiO2, FeO, CaO, K2O, Na2O, LOI, Cr, V, Ba, Cs, Rb, Sr, U, and Th, and moderate loss of Al2O3, MgO, Fe2O3, Ni, Cu, Pb, Tl, Sn, Sc, Ge and REE (Y). The high field strength elements TiO2, Sn, Sc, U, Ga, Ge, Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ta were immobile during weathering. The chemical changes and the Pb–Sr isotopic data suggest that four types of chemical reactions occurred: the oxidation of sulphide minerals (e.g., pyrite) and organic carbon (OS), the dissolution of less resistant clinochlore-Ia, calcite, and P-bearing minerals (DL), the dissolution of detrital albite and microcline (DA), and the transformation of clay (TC) minerals (e.g., muscovite and illite–smectite). These chemical reactions then led to two stages of geochemical processes, an early stage of chemical differentiation and a later stage of chemical homogenisation. The chemical differentiation dominated by the OS, DL, and DA reactions, led to the leaching of mobile elements (e.g., MgO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, Sr, and REE) and the redistribution of some less mobile elements (e.g., SiO2 and Al2O3). In contrast, the chemical homogenisation, which was caused by TC reactions, led to the leaching of both mobile and less mobile elements from the system and ultimately transformed the weathered black shales into soil. Soils derived from black shales in South China might result from the above two geochemical processes.},

Shale samples were retrieved from the borehole to study their source rock potential and trace element geochemical composition. Thirty shale samples analysed from borehole CDEG-2a reveal three geochemically distinct intervals. Shales from the top (23–38 m) interval are weathered and have negligible organic content. Shales from the middle (38–42 m) interval have moderate to good organic richness (0.6–1.7 wt.\% TOC) with Hydrogen Index (HI) values up to 443 mg S2/g TOC. Shales from the bottom (42–51 m) interval have poor to moderate organic richness (0.07–0.8 wt.\% TOC) with HI values up to 277 mg S2/g TOC. All samples have limited source rock potential and are immature to early mature for hydrocarbon generation. It is unlikely that they have ever been buried deeper than ∼2 km. Low TOC values ({\textless}2 wt.\%) together with low concentrations of uranium ({\textless}10 ppm) indicate the absence of organic-rich black shale (‘hot shale’) source rocks in the studied interval. Inorganic geochemical redox proxies (Ce-anomaly, authigenic U, Th/U, V/Cr, Ni/Co, and V/Sc) indicate that the lower Silurian Tanezzuft Formation shales from borehole CDEG-2a were deposited under oxic bottom waters, explaining their relatively low TOC values. Deposition took place in a shallow marine environment, in a proximal position with regard to an early Silurian palaeo-shoreline.

The litho-components of Late Paleocene shales were exposed to intermediate-strong weathering, and a decrease of weathering degree that probably accompanied with a shift to less oxic depositional environment was observed for the Lower Eocene shales. The change could be related to continental rift that associated with the opening of North Atlantic rifting zone at ∼56 Ma. Spatially, there is little elemental variability among the shales from different oil fields, except distinct lower Na contents in shales from the Cecilie field.

	abstract = {This work is focused on the turbiditic sediments from the Carboniferous Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG) in the South Portuguese Zone, an external zone of the Iberian Variscides. The aim of this work is to constrain the provenance and tectonic setting of these sediments in a context of a complex evolution of SW Iberian Variscides. For this purpose, we performed a systematic study of petrographical and geochemical signatures of greywackes and shales from the three BAFG formations: Mértola, Mira and Brejeira. Major and trace element composition and ratios suggest heterogeneous source area composition for BAFG shales and greywackes. For the oldest Mértola Formation greywackes, source area is dominated by granitoid rocks with minor mafic input. The latter becomes residual in the Mira Formation. The youngest Brejeira Formation greywackes show clear felsic affiliation associated with an increase in recycled components. The shales of all three BAFG formations denote a granodioritic affiliation. Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values suggest moderate weathering in the source areas of Mértola and Mira formations. These indices, together with A–CN–K relations, point out to steady-state weathering conditions in the source areas of both formations. In contrast, both CIA and PIA values for the Brejeira Formation indicate variable conditions of palaeoweathering, from moderate to intense, as a consequence of non-steady-state conditions probably triggered by tectonic instability in the provenance area. Compared to the greywackes, the shales of all three BAFG formations exhibit higher CIA and PIA values, as well as low K2O/Al2O3 ({\textasciitilde}0.2) and index of compositional variability ({\textless}1), reflecting the cumulative effect of multiple cycles of sedimentary recycling and prolonged chemical weathering history. Major and trace element distribution and upper continental crust-normalized multi-element plots suggest that the sediments of BAFG were derived mainly from a continental arc/active margin with minor contribution from old continental crust. Together, our geochemical data are compatible with BAFG sediments derived mainly from SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone (Gondwanan affinity), with possible contribution from an external (Avalonian) source.},

The rocks studied were shales from the Nishikurosawa, Onnagawa and Funakawa formations in stratigraphically ascending order. The Onnagawa sedimentary rocks in the lower (ca. 12.6–11.4 Ma), middle (ca. 10.6–9.0 Ma) and upper (ca. 8.3–7.0 Ma) horizons have high Mo/Al, Ni/Al, and Ba/Al ratios and high total organic carbon as well as high K/Ti and 87Sr/86Sr ratios and a positive Eu anomaly. These geochemical variations imply high primary productivity, and reducing conditions indicative of a deep paleo-ocean. The formation of petroleum source rocks on these horizons is attributed to increasing of nutrient delivery from the terrigenous system, which may have been induced by strong wind from Asian continent related to the uplift of Himalayan and Tibetan regions.},

	abstract = {Elemental and organic geochemical studies have been carried out on the Gondwana sediments, collected from the outcrops of Permian and Jurassic–Cretaceous rocks in the Krishna–Godavari basin on the eastern coast of India, to understand their paleo and depositional environment and its implications for hydrocarbon generation in the basin. Amongst the studied formations, the Raghavapuram, Gollapalli and Tirupati form a dominant Cretaceous Petroleum System in the west of the basin. Raghavapuram shales and its stratigraphic equivalents are the source rock and Gollapalli and Tirupati sandstones form the reservoirs, along with basaltic Razole formation as the caprock. Major element systematics and X-ray diffraction study of the sandstones indicate them to be variably enriched with SiO2 relative to Al2O3 and CaO, which is associated, inherently with the deposition and diagenesis of the Gondwana sediments. Post-Archean Average Shale normalized rare earth elements in shales show enrichment in most of the samples due to the increasing clay mineral and organic matter assemblage. A negative europium and cerium anomaly is exhibited by the REE's in majority of rocks. Composed primarily of quartz grains and silica cement, the Gollapalli and Tirupati sandstones have characteristics of high quality reservoirs. The shales show a significant increase in the concentration of redox sensitive trace elements, Ni, V, Cr, Ba and Zn. The total organic carbon content of the shales ranges between 0.1 and 0.5wt\%. Programmed pyrolysis of selected samples show the Tmax values to range between 352–497°C and that of hydrogen index to be between 57–460mgHC/gTOC. The organic matter is characterized by, mainly, gas prone Type III kerogen. The n-alkane composition is dominated by n-C11–C18 and acyclic isoprenoid, phytane. The aromatic fraction shows the presence of naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, chrysene and their derivatives, resulting largely from the diagenetic alteration of precursor terpenoids. The organic geochemical proxies indicate the input of organic matter from near-shore terrestrial sources and its deposition in strongly reducing, low oxygen conditions. The organic matter richness and maturity derived from a favorable depositional setting has its bearing upon the Gondwana sediments globally, and also provides promising exploration opportunities, particularly in the Raghavapuram sequence of the KG basin.},

	abstract = {The Upper Triassic Chang 7 non-marine hot shales have been proven to contribute to Mesozoic oil reservoirs in the Ordos basin, Central China. These shales have been studied extensively in sedimentology, petrology and organic geochemistry. However, the factors controlling the development of the shales are still ambiguously constrained. This paper presents the major, trace, and platinum-group elements (PGEs) data to address these issues. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW), C-values and clay mineral compositions indicate that the Chang 7 hot shales were developed in a humid paleoclimate. The indicators of redox conditions (Eu/Eu∗, Ce/Ce∗, Ceanom, δU, U/Th, V/(V+Ni) and V/Cr) suggest that the Chang 7 hot shales were developed under anoxic environment. Uranium enrichment (average 46.10ppm) is an important distinguished signature of the Chang 7 hot shales, which was mainly related to synchronous volcanic ash sediments and/or possibly hydrothermal fluids. The PGE concentrations of the Chang 7 hot shales were reported for the first time here, and can be subdivided into two groups. The total abundances of the Group One samples are relatively lower and derived mainly from detrital minerals, while the Group Two samples are relatively higher, and are also likely linked to the synchronous volcanic ash sediments and/or possibly hydrothermal fluids. Combined with the regional geological setting, we tentatively propose that the tectonics is the major control on the development of the Chang 7 hot shales.},

Systematic sampling and geochemical analysis of these deposits has revealed that the parent rocks of the oil shale underwent moderate chemical weathering; and that its mineralogy and trace and rare earth element geochemistry were mainly controlled by parent rock composition, with no synsedimentary changes in the source terrain. Based on source rock and tectonic setting discrimination diagrams, we concluded that the parent rocks of the oil shale were mostly basalts of the Paleogene Laohutai Formation. These basalts originated in a continental back arc environment and contain abundant nutrient elements such as Fe, P, Ni, Cu and Zn, all of which are essential for the growth of aquatic photoautotrophs in lakes. Continuous, high primary productivity in the Jinjuntun lacustrine depocentre, combined with a stable tectonic setting and underfilled sedimentary environment, were key factors in the genesis of its oil shale.},

The most productive coal seams in the mine are the Nos. 11, 9 and 4. Twenty-five samples of coals, partings, and roof shales from the Nos. 11, 10, 9, 5 (Taiyuan Formation), and 4 (Shanxi Formation) seams in the Antaibao mine were analyzed for ash, and total sulfur contents and forms of sulfur. The No. 11 seam is a medium- to high-sulfur coal (1.3–3.1\% S). A coal sample (14.1\% ash) from the No. 10 seam contains 3.4\%, and high ash coal (37.4\% ash) from the same seam contains only 0.4\% total sulfur. The No. 9 seam is a low- to medium-sulfur coal (0.6–1.3\% S). The highest sulfur content among the samples is 5.8\% total sulfur from a coal sample of the No. 5 seam. The No. 4 seam is low-sulfur coal (0.29–0.54\% S). The remarkable variation in sulfur content among the coal seams in the Taiyuan and Shanxi Formations could reflect different depositional environments; from coastal to lower deltaic plain for the Taiyuan, and from upper deltaic plain to fluvial basin for the Shanxi Formation. The sulfate sulfur comes mainly from the oxidation of pyrite. Sixteen samples were analyzed for 26 major, minor and trace elements by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The Sr content is significantly higher in coals from the No. 4 seam in the Shanxi Formation than those from Nos. 11 to 5 seams. Chlorine, Sr, Ca and P are elements bound organically; while Si, Al, Ti, Fe, K, Na, Mg, Cr, V, Ni, Rb, Ba and Nb are mainly associated with minerals.},

These characteristics and the barium–cobalt ratios show that the early sediments were derived from a more mafic provenance and the contribution of granitoids increased towards the later stages of Kaladgi sedimentation.

The sandstones from the Belden Formation have higher quartz/feldspar ratios than do those from the Maroon and Sangre de Cristo Formations. Also, the alkali feldspar (i.e., orthoclase, microcline, perthite)/plagioclase ratio decreases in the order Sangre de Cristo Formation{\textgreater}Maroon Formation{\textgreater}Belden Formation, but the CIW′ (chemical index of weathering=molecular [Al2O3/(Al2O3+Na2O)]∗100) decreases in the order Belden Formation{\textgreater}Sangre de Cristo Formation{\textgreater}Maroon Formation. This suggests that the Belden Formation had a more plagioclase-rich granitoid source and more intense weathering of the source than did the Maroon and Sangre de Cristo Formations. Also, the variation in the elemental composition within the terrigenous sediment may be explained in terms of the variation in the observed minerals. Elemental ratios critical of provenance are statistically the same between the finer sediment of the Maroon and Sangre de Cristo Formations and fall within the range of a granitoid provenance, suggesting a similar granitoid source composition for the two formations. The fine sediment from the Belden Formation, however, has significantly more negative Eu anomalies and lower La/Sc and Th/Cr ratios than those of the Maroon and Sangre de Cristo Formations, suggesting a more differentiated granitoid source for the Belden than for the Maroon and Sangre de Cristo Formations. Most elemental concentrations or ratios vary by a factor of 0.12 to 60 between adjacent fine and coarse sediment ({\textless}1-m distances). Thus, it is not recommended that metasedimentary sequences similar in composition to this study be examined to determine element mobility during metamorphism as the variation due to sedimentary processes is so large.},

	abstract = {The Dahuangshan oil shale, located in the northern Bogda Mountain, on the southern margin of the Junggar Basin, was deposited in a Late Permian lacustrine environment. A combined investigation of element and organic geochemistry was performed to define the source rock potential, the paleoenvironment, and source of the organic matter. Thick sequences of oil shales with an average thickness of 638m were deposited in Lucaogou Formation which mainly consists of oil shale, argillaceous dolomite, silty claystone, tuff, limestone, and dolomitic marl. A spot of plant stem fossils and abundance of pyrite crystals, fishtail and fish skeleton can also be found there. Analyzed oil shale samples from Dahuangshan area are characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) contents (5.6–34.75\%), S2 (22.65–199.25mgHC/g rock), hydrogen index (HI, 359–1068mgHC/g TOC), and oil yield (4.9–26.6\%), indicating the oil shales have excellent source rock potential. Tmax values (433–453°C) show an early to medium maturation stage of organic matter, which is supported by organic geochemical maturation parameters. All of the obtained kerogen types are types II and I, with oil prone source rock potential. Dahuangshan oil shale samples are rich in SiO2 (68.59\%), followed by Al2O3 (10.18\%) and Fe2O3 (5.43\%). Compared with average shale and North American Shale Composite (NASC), analyzed oil shale samples are obviously enriched in P (0.71\%). There is a significant correlation between Al2O3 and Fe2O3, MgO, K2O, MnO, Cu, Ba, Co, and Ni for their association with clay minerals. Besides, the significant correlations between Fe2O3 and MnO, Co, and Ni are considered to result from their similarity on geochemical behavior. All selected oil shales are characterized by distinctly sloping light rare earth elements (LREE) trends (LaN/SmN=2.70–5.95) accompanied by flat heavy rare earth elements (HREE) trends, with distinct Eu negative anomalies (0.60–0.73). Two slightly different patterns of REEs in the oil shale samples are distinguished by the difference in Ce depletion and Nd anomaly. In addition, Dahuangshan oil shale samples are characterized by short- to middle-chain n-alkanes, low carbon preference index (CPI) values (0.93–1.24), single peak composed of nC20 or nC22, low Pr/Ph (0.41–0.91), relatively high Homohop index (0.061–0.99), and high concentrations of C27 sterane, indicating reducing, deep-water, and moderate saline environment with prevalent contribution of algae and microorganisms to organic matter accumulation.},

	abstract = {This study presents ReOs isotopes and major and trace elemental geochemistry of carbonaceous (black) shales and a weathering profile developed on them from the Paleoproterozoic deposits of the Jhamarkotra Formation, Lower Aravalli Group, India. These measurements provide information on the impact of post-depositional processes, particularly hydrothermal fluid interactions, on the 187Re187Os geochronology and element mobility in shales. In contrast to previously reported compositions for black shales, the Re concentrations of the Jhamarkotra shales are in general lower than their corresponding Os concentrations. The 187Os/188Os ratios of the black shales vary widely, from 3.5 to 10.5, without any discernible systematic trend with 187Re/188Os (range: 0.4 to 17.7; excluding an outlier); these 187Re/188Os ratios are lower by a few orders of magnitude than those generally reported for “fresh” black shales. These observations indicate that the Jhamarkotra shales, though they seem visually well preserved, have undergone post-depositional modification, resulting in “open system” behavior of Re and Os, with Re more mobile than Os. Higher SiO2/TiO2 and K2O/Na2O ratios of the Jhamarkotra shales compared to their sediment provenance suggest interaction of the shales with hydrothermal (possibly Si and K-rich) fluids. The SiO2/TiO2 ratios (an index for hydrothermal alteration) show negative correlation with Re/Corg and positive correlation with Corg/N ratios (42–154), indicating loss of Re and nitrogen during hydrothermal fluid interaction. Earlier studies have shown the presence of Re porphyrins (N-containing organic compounds) in black shales. Thus, the observed co-variations of SiO2/TiO2 with Re/Corg and Corg/N ratios suggest mobilization of Re from the porphyrins in the shales. Further, positive correlation between SiO2/TiO2 and 187Os/188Os ratios indicates that significant amounts of radiogenic Os component were re-distributed throughout the Jhamarkotra shales during the post-depositional processes. In the weathering profile developed on black shales, the Al2O3-normalized abundance ratios of mobile major elements are in general lower in the upper layers relative to those in deeper sections attesting to their preferential mobility during chemical weathering. On the contrary, the Al2O3-normalized ratios of trace elements mostly showed insignificant depth variations in the weathering profile, suggesting limited mobility over the depth of the profile. The depth profiles of Re/Al2O3 and 188Os/Al2O3 and 187Os/188Os ratios in the weathering profile by and large reflect compositions of their presumed parent shales, which have gone through significant post-depositional changes.},

	abstract = {The Lunpola oil shale is the largest oil shale resource in Tibet. Twenty-four samples of oil shale, mudstone, and dolomite were collected from the Lunpola oil shale for mineralogical and trace element analyses. The vertical distribution and mode of occurrence of trace elements in this terrestrial oil shale were also discussed. Oil shale samples from the Lunpola area have high TOC contents (5.1–10.6\%), high ash yields (74.8–84.7\%), low total sulfur contents (0.19–1.03\%), and high shale oil contents (5.0–10.3\%). The major minerals in the oil shale samples are clays, quartz, calcite and dolomite, with minor quantities of feldspar, siderite, hematite, magnesite and pyrite. Other minerals such as halite, zeolite, barite, anhydrite, and mirabilite were detected in some oil shale samples. The contents of As, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ce, Cs, Hg, La, Li, Mo, Nd, Pb, Pr, Rb, Se, Sm, Th, U, W, and Zr are enriched from 1.30 to 125 times as compared to their average crust abundance (Clarke values), whereas the other elements are slightly higher or lower than their respective Clarke values. Compared to common Australian oil shale, the Lunpola oil shales contain higher As, Ba, Be, Ce, Co, Cs, Ga, Gd, Hf, Nb, Nd, Pb, Pr, Rb, Sc, Sm, Sn, Th, and Zr, but lower Cd, Cu, Lu, Mo, Ni, Se, Sr, U, V, and Zn. Elements associated with organic matter and/or Fe-sulfides are highly enriched in all oil shale deposits, suggesting that their speciation in oil shale is governed by general processes (e.g., high organic matter content and anoxic environment), whereas elements associated with clay minerals exhibit various enrichments indicating that their speciation in oil shale is governed by individual geochemical mechanisms (e.g., source rocks). The elements in the Lunpola oil shale may be classified into three groups of associations according to their modes of occurrence. Group A elements (TiO2, Sc, Hf, Zr, Be, Li, W, V, Zn, SiO2, Al2O3, Rb, Ga, Sn, Cr, Ta, Cs, K2O, Th, Na2O, REEs, and ash yield) have high positive correlations with ash yield and a mainly inorganic affinity. Group B elements (As, TOC, MnO, Ni, Fe2O3, Cd, Co, Cu, Mo, Se, MgO, Bi, Pb, and Hg) show a negative correlation with ash yield, and most elements possibly have a likely organic affinity and/or Fe-sulfide affinity. Group C elements (Sr, CaO, U, and P2O5) show a weak or negligible correlation with ash yield (with the exception of CaO). Elements of environmental concern (As, Bi, Hg, Mo, Pb, Se, and U) are present in high contents, and are clustered in the second association, i.e. they are hosted mainly in Fe-sulfides and/or organic matter.},

	abstract = {The Meihe Basin is a Paleogene pull-apart basin. Long-flame coal, lignite and oil shale are coexisting energy resources deposited in this basin. Ninety-seven samples, including oil shales, coals, brown to gray silt and mudstone, have been collected from the oil shale- and coal-bearing layers to discover the rare earth element geochemistry. The total REE contents of oil shales and coals are 137–256μg/g and 64–152μg/g respectively. The chondrite-normalized patterns of oil shales and coals show LREE enrichments, HREE deficits, negative Eu anomalies and negligible Ce anomalies. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) as well as some trace elements is often used to reflect the paleoenvironment at the time of deposition. The results show that fine-grained sediments in both layers were deposited in dysoxic to oxic conditions and in a warm and humid climate, and coals were deposited in a warmer and more humid climate than oil shales. Oil shales and coals are both in the early stage of diagenesis and of terrigenous origin. Besides, diagrams of some major, trace and rare earth elements show that the fine-grained sediments of both layers in the Meihe Basin are mainly from the felsic volcanic rocks and granite, and that their source rocks are mostly deposited in the continental inland arc setting. The analysis of major elements shows that Si, Al, K and Ti, in both layers, are found mainly in a mixed clay mineral assemblage and that Si is also found in quartz. Sodium occurs primarily in clay minerals, whereas Ca is found mainly in the organic matter. In the coal-bearing layer, iron is mainly controlled by organic matter rather than detrital minerals. In contrast, in the oil shale-bearing layer, neither detrital minerals nor organic matter exert a control on the iron content. Analyzing the relationship between rare earth elements and major elements shows that REEs in the oil shales and the coals are both of terrigenous origin and are mainly controlled by detrital minerals rather than by organic matter. In both layers, REEs have no relationship with fine-grained phosphates, and during the weathering process, the REEs were not very mobile and were resistant to fractionation.},

	abstract = {Lower Cretaceous sediments are frequently characterized by a well expressed cyclicity. While the processes influencing environments above the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) are reasonably well understood, almost nothing is known about the deep ocean. Cretaceous sub-CCD sediments from the Tethys and Atlantic Oceans typically show rhythmic black/green shale successions. To gain insight into the nature of these black/green shale cycles, we performed detailed geochemical analyses (X-ray fluorescence, Rock-Eval and reactive iron analysis) on a 3 m long section of latest Aptian age. The major-element distribution of the analyzed shale sequence indicates a periodic change from a high-productivity and well-oxygenated green shale mode to a low-productivity oxygen-deficient black shale mode. It is proposed here that the preservation of organic matter was dependent on the strength of salinity-driven deepwater generation. Furthermore, the data show that the Corg content covaries with changes in the detrital composition. Therefore we hypothesize that Tethyan deepwater circulation was sensitive to changes in the monsoonal system. Time series analysis suggests that these changes are periodic in nature, although we are currently unable to prove that the dominant periodicity is related to the precession component of the Milankovitch frequencies.},

	abstract = {Archean metasedimentary rocks occur as components of the Isua supracrustals, Akilia association and Malene supracrustals of southern West Greenland. Primary structures in these rocks have been destroyed by metamorphism and deformation. Their chemistry and mineralogy is consistent with a sedimentary origin, but other possible parents (e.g. acid volcanics, altered pyroclastic rocks) cannot be excluded for some of them. There is little difference in the composition of metasedimentary rocks from the early Archean Isua supracrustals and probable correlative Akilia association. Both have a wide range in rare earth element (REE) patterns with LaNYbN ranging from 0.61−5.8. The REE pattern of one Akilia sample, with low LaNYbN, compares favourably with that of associated tholeiites and it is likely that such samples were derived almost exclusively from basaltic sources. Other samples with very steep REE patterns are similar to felsic volcanic boulders found in a conglomeratic unit in the Isua supracrustals. Samples with intermediate REE patterns are best explained by mixing of basaltic and felsic end members. Metasedimentary rocks from the Malene supracrustals can be divided into low silica (≤55\% SiO2) and high silica ({\textgreater}77\% SiO2) varieties. These rocks also show much variation in LaNYbN (0.46−14.0) and their origin is explained by derivation from a mixture of mafic volcanics and felsic igneous rocks. The wide range in trace element characteristics of these metasedimentary rocks argues for inefficient mixing of the various source lithologies during sedimentation. Accordingly, these data do not rigorously test models of early Archean crustal composition and evolution. The systematic variability in trace element geochemistry provides evidence for the bimodal nature of the early Archean crust.},

Shales from turbidites in the Gorge Creek Group (ca. 3.4 Ae) and shales from the Whim Creek Group (ca. 2.7 Ae) have been examined. The Gorge Creek Group samples, characterized by muscovite-quartzchlorite mineralogy, are enriched in incompatible elements (K, Th, U, LREE) by factors of about two, when compared to younger Archean shales from the Yilgarn Block. Alkali and alkaline earth elements are depleted in a systematic fashion, according to size, when compared with an estimate of Archean upper crust abundances. This depletion is less notable in the Whim Creek Group. Such a pattern indicates the source of these rocks underwent a rather severe episode of weathering. The Gorge Creek Group also has fairly high B content (85 ± 29 ppm) which may indicate normal marine conditions during deposition. Rare earth element (REE) patterns for the Pilbara samples are characterized by light REE enrichment (LaNYbN ≥ 7.5) and no or very slight Eu depletion (EuEu∗ = 0.82 – 0.99). A source comprised of about 80\% felsic igneous rocks without large negative Eu-anomalies (felsic volcanics, tonalites, trondhjemites) and 20\% mafic-ultramafic volcanics is indicated by the trace element data. Very high abundances of Cr and Ni cannot be explained by any reasonable provenance model and a secondary enrichment process is called for.},

Contrasting datasets have been used to advocate for and against the rise of free oxygen in the atmosphere prior to 2.4Ga based on various geochemical tracers, and evidence for a partially oxidized environment remains elusive. Herein, we present stable isotope datasets for Mo and Cr, in conjunction with major and trace elements from four black shale horizons spanning a time interval from 3.46 to 2.76Ga in order to ascertain atmospheric oxygen levels through the Archean. The Mo, Cr and U elemental signatures within all sedimentary units are dominated by continental input. Both Mo isotopic values and Mo and U elemental signatures suggest anoxic conditions with no indication of redox cycling of these elements. This contradicts previous interpretations of an oxidized atmosphere based on published sulfur isotopic data (Ohmoto et al., 2006) and oxidized hematite occurrences at {\textasciitilde}3.45Ga (Hoashi et al., 2009). Cr concentration patterns within the sample suites are controlled by continental provenance composition rather than by an authigenic Cr seawater contribution. This interpretation is supported by the relatively homogeneous Cr isotopic compositions across all sample suites and is consistent with high temperature controlled Cr isotopic ratios. Identification of redox cycling processes within detrital dominated sediments with Cr isotopes is likely to be less sensitive compared to Mo isotopes, due to the much smaller authigenic/crustal enrichment factors for Cr.},

	abstract = {Early Proterozoic (1.8-1.7 Ga) metasedimentary rocks in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, USA, can be divided into turbidite successions (commonly volcanogenic) associated with mafic/felsic metavolcanic successions (e.g., Irving Fm.) and stable shelf quartzite-pelite successions of shallow marine origin (e.g., Hondo Gp.). Metapelites from the turbidite successions reported here have low K2O/Na2O, low Th/U ({\textless}3.0), low to moderate Th/Sc (0.1-0.6), and slight negative Eu-anomalies, although regionally, negative Eu-anomalies in such rocks are common. At the time of sedimentation (ca. 1.7-1.8 Ga), ɛNd values were in the range +3 to +7, indistinguishable from associated metavolcanic and plutonic rocks. Similarly, lead isotopic data scatter about a 1.7 Ga reference isochron. Low κ (232Th/238U) values for the Irving Formation are consistent with derivation from crustal sources similar to the southern Colorado/northern New Mexico lead isotope crustal province. These data are further consistent with a volcanic arc related origin. In contrast, stable shelf metapelites have high K2O/Na2O, variable but commonly high Th/U (2.0–7.0), moderate to high Th/Sc (0.5-1.4), and substantial negative Eu-anomalies. Although compositions are rather variable, they are typical of post-Archean shales. Neodymium isotopes are surprisingly radiogenic with ɛNd(1.7 Ga) in the range -0.2 to +4. Lead isotopic data for the least radiogenic samples also are consistent with a dominantly juvenile source and on a 207Pb/204Pb vs. 206Pb/204Pb diagram, data scatter slightly above the 1.7 Ga reference isochron, suggesting minor components of significantly older material. Lead isotopic systematics suggest that a major component of the provenance was derived from the immediately associated metavolcanic-plutonic terranes, consistent with suggestions of a first-cycle origin, but with an Archean component. Isotopic data restrict the Archean component to about 10\%, on average, and no more than 25\% in any sample. This older crustal component may be derived either by direct erosion of Archean rocks, such as the Wyoming Province, or indirectly through assimilation into Early Proterozoic igneous rocks. Although the stable shelf sedimentary rocks are derived from a provenance with similar ages as the volcanogenic turbidites, the geochemical characteristics of the provenance are significantly different. Accordingly, these data are consistent with especially rapid and widespread crustal growth and evolution in southwestern North America during the period 1.9-1.7 Ga. Several samples from the Hondo Group and Uncompahgre Formation have REE patterns that are rotated to LREE depletion and perhaps HREE enrichment. The change in REEs correlate with Mo, U, and V abundances and Pb isotopic characteristics suggesting sedimentary processes similar to those operating in black shales affected these REE patterns. REE patterns and Th/U ratios of Early Proterozoic volcanogenic turbidites examined in this and other studies differ on average from turbidites found in Archean greenstone belts. Negative Eu-anomalies are common, HREE-depletion is seen but comparatively rare, and Th/U ratios are commonly below 3.0. Accordingly, these data are consistent with models suggesting that the upper crust had a different composition in the Archean.},

	abstract = {The Cuddapah Supergroup is one of the series of thick Proterozoic sedimentary sequences developed on Archean cratonic peninsular India. The stratigraphically higher Cumbum Formation includes well-preserved and unweathered black shales, that include marine facies, recording lower greenschist facies metamorphism. In multielement normalized diagrams, conservative elements (Ti, Al, REE, Sc, Co) plot parallel, and close to, post-Archean upper continental crust (PA-UCC). Small variations in absolute concentrations of conservative elements covary with Fe2O3 content, which ranges from 1.6–11wt.\%; accordingly, those concentrations are controlled by hydrothermal leaching or additions of Fe, consistent with reduced fluids reflected in variable Eu anomalies. In Th/Sc vs. Sc co-ordinates, these shales trend to slightly lower Sc but greater Th/Sc than either PA-UCC or average Proterozoic shale. Cratonic lithologies, such as tonalite clasts or detrital gold, are not represented in basal conglomerates, and REE systematics and low Al2O3/Yb, Th/Yb, and Zr/Sm ratios rule out a significant tonalite component in the source; consequently, both sedimentary and geochemical evidences endorse an extra-cratonic provenance. The best compositional fit is to average Paleoproterozoic, Andean-type continental margin, granite, with ∼10\% of Closepet-type granite contributing to the excess Zr and REE. An active continental margin provenance is also consistent with the Th–Sc–Zr discriminant diagram of siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The chemical index of alteration (CIA), corrected for diagenetic addition of K, is 85–100 indicative of intense weathering of the catchment, compared to a range of mean values of 70–88 at ∼1.8Ga. Shales are variably enriched in V–Cr–Ni relative to PA-UCC consistent with the established kerogen–transition metal association. The Cuddapah Supergroup may have evolved as a foreland basin to the 2.1–1.8Ga Central Indian Tectonic Zone, with its associated granites, evolving into an intracontinental basin connected to the ocean given the marine kerogen–V–Ni association. This scenario is similar to the Paleoproterozoic McArther River, Australia, and Athabasca, Canada, basins which evolved from foreland basins respectively to the Barrumundi and Trans Hudson orogens, collectively as part of assembly of the proposed Paleoproterozoic supercontinent Columbia.},

Petrographic results suggest that the arenites may have been derived from granites and that the wackes may have been derived from more plagioclase-rich rocks like tonalites or granodiorites. The high quartz relative to other materials in many sandstones suggest that they may have been derived from intense chemical weathering or diagenesis so the mineralogic ratios may have been changed during these processes. The shales and siltstones are composed mostly of illite and quartz. In addition, A–CN–K diagrams indicate that the wackes and associated shales and siltstones underwent K-metasomatisim. Extrapolation of the shales and siltstones associated with the wackes back to the plagioclase–alkali feldspar line in the A–CN–K diagram suggests a high average plagioclase to alkali feldspar ratio in the provenance (tonalite to granodiorite). Extrapolation of shales and siltstones associated with the arenites suggest a low plagioclase to alkali feldspar ratio in the provenance (granite). In addition, the index of compositional variability (ICV) and chemical index of alteration (CIA) parameters of the shales and siltstones suggest the weathering of the first cycle material was intense. Trace element ratios suggest all the sedimentary rocks were derived from mostly granitoids. Shales and siltstones were plotted as elemental ratios (e.g. Th/Sc vs. Eu/Eu*). These plots suggest a mix of a granodiorite–tonalite source (for the source of the shales and siltstones associated with the wackes) with a granite source (for the shales and siltstones associated with the arenites). The arenites also contain lower Eu/Eu* and higher Th/Co and Th/Sc ratios than the wackes. This, as is consistent with the petrography, suggests that the arenites were derived from a source with more granite and less granodiorite–tonalite than the wackes.},

Factor analysis allowed the lithology of the mudstone to be broken down into variable proportions of two inputs, a dry felsic component and a hydrous mafic component (smectite or chlorite). Zircons U-Pb ages indicate multiple sources, the local Proterozoic basement of Northern Greenland (1250?2400 Ma) and Pan-African felsic magmas (620?650 Ma) from across the Iapetus ocean. Diagenesis involved the reduction of Fe, S, and Mo from seawater and pyritization. The Sirius Passet Lagerstätte formed in oxygen-starved muds inhibiting degradation of organic matter underneath a well-ventilated water column. The chemistry of the samples, their very fine grain size, their apparent lack of graded bedding, and the age of zircons suggest that the Lagerstätte may represent wind-blown dust deposited on the continental slope.},

Gold contents of lower Paleozoic carbonate platform, shelf, and transitional facies are comparable to the average crustal abundance of ∼2 ppb. Gold concentrations of the siliciclastic rocks correlate stratigraphically with high total organic carbon, total metal contents, vanadium ratio [V/(V+Ni)], and authigenic uranium, and with low δ¹³C(org) and cerium anomaly. These geochemical parameters are indicative of a low-O₂ paleo-environment, interpreted to result from high organic productivity in upwelling zones. The origin of the gold enrichments in lower Paleozoic, siliciclastic strata is related to global conditions in the marine environment during the early Paleozoic. Hydrothermal and detrital inputs of gold to the oceans were higher than at other times. Organic activity in upwelling zones contributed to the accumulation and preservation of gold in marginal marine sediments. Lower Paleozoic strata are favorable hosts for gold mineralization because they are associated with gold-enriched, carbonaceous siliciclastic strata that may act as a source and/or trap for gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids.},

	abstract = {Upper Permian and Lower Triassic (Griesbachian, Dienerian, Smithian and Spathian) shales in the Salt Range, Pakistan, were deposited at the margin of Gondwana during a time of active rifting. XRF and INAA major element, trace element and rare earth element (REE) analyses of shales exhibit progressive change in chemistry from Upper Permian to Spathian. SiO2/Al2O3 decreases upsection, and K2O/Na2O increases, together with an increase in the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA). HFS elements are enriched relative to PAAS at the base of the sequence, but are progressively depleted upward. Most compatible elements are depleted throughout, relative to PAAS. Sc, however, is relatively enriched, producing a general decline in Th/Sc upward. With the exception of a single sample at the base of the sequence, ∑REE shows little variation from Upper Permian to Smithian, ranging from 159 to 146, but increases to 206 in the Spathian. Chondrite-normalised LaN/YbN also increases upsection, from ∼9.0 to 12.8. Eu/Eu* values are 0.48–0.54 in the Upper Permian–Dienerian sequence, but anomalies become smaller (0.53–0.65) and more similar to PAAS (0.66) in the Smithian and Spathian. Such values are typical of continentally derived sediments, but the slight decrease upward suggests a small influx of more mafic material. This, and decreasing Th/Sc, contrasts with increasing LaN/YbN and ∑REE, which imply an increasingly felsic source. These anomalies may be resolved by modeling potential sources using the REE and Th/Sc. The modeling suggests that the Permian–Dienerian sediments could have been derived from a source of Upper Proterozoic crust (UPC), Phanerozoic granite (PG) and amphibolite (AMP) in ratios around 60:38:2. In the Smithian and Spathian, proportions change to 76:20:4 and 68:28:4, respectively. Although the increase in the AMP component is small, when combined with increase in UPC at the expense of PG, it is sufficient to approximate the changes in Th/Sc and Eu/Eu*. LaN/YbN ratios in the Permian–Dienerian may be influenced by concentrations of HREE-enriched garnet and zircon. CIA indices and A–CN–K relations show that source weathering conditions oscillated between non-steady state (Permian, Dienerian, Smithian) and steady state (Griesbachian, Spathian), indicative of episodic uplift at the Gondwana margin. CIA ratios in the Spathian are greatest in the Spathian, indicative of more intense weathering at that time. However, A–CN–K relations, ∑REE contents and the modeled UPC:PG:AMP mix in the Spathian could also have been produced by recycling of Smithian sediments.},

The tuff is a high-K, low-Na rhyolite with dominantly K-feldspar phenocrysts. Cathodoluminescence color of the quartz phenocrysts is blue. U-Pb isotopic analyses (LA MC-ICPMS) of magmatic zircons separated from the tuff give a weighted-mean average 207Pb/206Pb age of 1001 ע 7 Ma that we interpret as the age of crystallization. We conclude that the closure age of the Indravati succession is ca. 1000 Ma, very similar to that of the Chhattisgarh and Vindhyan successions. The age of this tuff is identical, within analytical errors, to those of the Sukhda and Dhamda Tuffs in the Chhattisgarh Basin some 350 km away. We suggest that these three tuffs represent a ca. 1000-Ma rhyolitic ﬂare-up, possibly related to the assembly of Rodinia and docking of India and East Antarctica.},

The samples are from outcrops located about 10 km apart, approximately along strike and stratigraphically near the top of the Chhattisgarh Succession in the western Hirri Subbasin. These results indicate that the Dhamda Tuff is coeval with the Sukhda Tuffs of the eastern Baradwar Subbasin, which previously yielded ages of 990–1020 Ma. The new ages confirm the prediction of geologists of the Indian Statistical Institute who, when creating a new mapping of part of the Chhattisgarh Basin, suggested that the Sukhda and Dhamda tuffs are correlative. The new data also confirm that deposition in the Chhattisgarh Basin occurred essentially between ca. 1400 and ca. 1000 Ma. The Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB), then a part East Antarctica, docked with the southern Indian block at about 1000 Ma; hence, EGMB could not have supplied detritus to Chhattisgarh and other Mesoproterozoic basins in the region. Further, the new age data, combined with earlier dating of the Sukhda Tuffs, indicate that a major event of rhyolitic volcanism occurred in central India at about 1000 Ma, possibly coinciding with the closure or perhaps the uplift or inversion of the Chhattisgarh and other similar basins. Several approximately coeval thermal-magmatic events are recorded in rocks of south-central India. We hypothesize that these events are far-field effects of the collision of EGMB during the final assembly of Rodinia.},

The sequence is more than 1200m thick and crops out as tectonically duplicated, but stratigraphically distinct tectono-stratigraphic units. Chemical weathering of the source terrain of Fig Tree strata was minor. Instead, hydrothermal-metasomatic events affected the sedimentary rocks in the study area, resulting in the depletion of alkaline earth elements and K metasomatism. Provenance modelling using REEs and trace element ratios indicate varying contributions from ultramafic to mafic greenstones, TTGs and HREE-undepleted granites. A clear stratigraphic control on the composition, in the form of increasing trace metal contents and decreasing LaN/YbN ratios, reflects progressive increase of ultramafic and mafic volcanic rocks in the source. Banded iron formation shows REE-Y patterns consistent with its precipitation in a marine environment from Eu-enriched seawater. Carbonaceous cherts at the base of the Fig Tree Group do not represent chemical precipitates out of a hot Archaean ocean, but represent carbonaceous sediments that were silicified during low-temperature hydrothermal fluid emanations on the seafloor.},

	abstract = {The SE margin of the Yangtze Block, South China is composed of the Mesoproterozoic Lengjiaxi Group and the Neoproterozoic Banxi Group, with Sinian- and post-Sinian-cover. A geochemical study was undertaken on the Mesoproterozoic–Neoproterozoic clastic sediments in order to delineate the characteristics of the sediment source and to constrain the tectonic development and crustal evolution of South China. Our results show that the Mesoproterozoic clastic sediments have a dominant component derived from a metavolcanic-plutonic terrane, with a large of mafic component. There is a minor contribution of mafic rocks and older upper crustal rocks to the provenance. Strong chemical weathering in the source area occurred before transport and deposition. The provenance for the Neoproterozoic clastic sediments was most likely old upper continental crust composed of tonalite–granodiorite-dominated, tonalite–granodiorite–granite source rocks, which had undergone strong weathering and/or recycling. A minor component of older K-rich granitic plutonic rocks and younger volcanogenic bimodal rocks is also indicated. Based on the regional geology, the geochemical data and the inferred provenance, the Mesoproterozoic Group is interpreted as a successive sedimentary sequence, deposited in an extensional/rifting back-arc basin, adjacent to a {\textgreater}1.80Ga continental margin arc-terrane. The progressive extension/rifting of the back-arc basin was followed by increasing subsidence and regional uplift during continental marginal arc-continent (the Cathaysian Block) collision at ∼1.0Ga caused the deposition of the Neoproterozoic Group into back-arc to retro-arc foreland basin. Therefore, the depositional setting of the Proterozoic clastic sediments and associated volcanic rocks within the back-arc basin reflected basin development from an active continental margin (back-arc basin), with extension or rifting of the back-arc basin, to a passive continental margin.},

In the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, an Early Paleozoic flysch sequence extensively occurs in the Chinese Altai and adjacent western Mongolian terranes. Sedimentary rocks in the northwestern Chinese Altai were collected from the flysch sequence for geochemical and Nd isotopic studies. Although these rocks show different geochemical characteristics (e.g., arenaceous and argillaceous), they all have relatively low CIA (Chemical Index of Alteration) values (49–75), indicating a relatively weak weathering source or the absence of compositionally mature alumina-rich minerals produced by chemical weathering processes. Their relatively high ICV (Index of Compositional Variability) values (0.95–1.35) reveal an immature source and indicate that these rocks were probably deposited in an active tectonic setting. The sedimentary rocks from the flysch sequence have high MgO, Sc, Co and low Y, Nb, which suggest significant addition of mafic rocks into the source. Modeling based on Nb–Cr and Zr–MgO contents displays nearly 20\% to 50\% addition of mafic materials. In combination with the age and distribution of mafic rocks in the Chinese Altai and adjacent terranes, a northward-derived mafic source is recommended for the sedimentary sequence. Although the sedimentary rocks have Nd model ages (TDM=1.44–1.57Ga) older than Devonian granites (TDM=1.6–1.1Ga), young detrital zircons from the sediments and inherited zircons from the granites (450–500Ma) suggest a mixed source consisting of both old crust components and juvenile or less evolved crustal components. This reveals that Nd model ages (TDM) of metasedimentary rocks and igneous rocks can hardly provide close constrains on the timing of crustal formation in accretionary orogen. With the progresses in adjacent western Mongolian terranes, a tectonic scenario dominated by subduction-accretionary process is suggested to interpret the formation of the Early Paleozoic flysch sequence in the Chinese Altai and adjacent terranes.},

The geochemical data shows decrease in the abundance of mafic major elements and transition elements, and an increase in the large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) from the Paleoproterozoic pelites to the Meso-Neoproterozoic shales. This suggests partial exposure of granitoids in the Paleoproterozoic and unroofing of the granitoids by the complete removal of mafic rocks in the provenance as the Meso-Neoproterozoic sedimentation progressed. Overall, the study of the Meso-Neoproterozoic sandstones and shales show homogeneity in the source rock composition with strong felsic component. However, the Paleoproterozoic pelites and quartzites show heterogeneity in the source rock composition with mixture of the felsic and mafic components.

The use of biplots of clr-transformed variables allows discrimination of two different groups of shales. High CIA values reveal a strongly weathered source area especially for the Numidian shales. The analyses of mixed-layered clay minerals indicate that the behaviour of K2O and geochemical affine elements is controlled by the diagenetic grade, which increases from south-west to north-east in response to tectonic loading. Ratios of selected elements (Zr, Y, La, Nb, Ti, Co, Cr, Ni), considered essentially unchanged with respect to the source rocks, are similar in the scaly and variegated shales, and resemble the Variscan Peloritani metamorphic basement. In contrast, the distinct geochemical signature of the Numidian shales reveals a source similar to the average cratonic sandstone, suggesting derivation from external sources located in the foreland.

	abstract = {The Triassic to Lowermost Jurassic mudrocks from continental redbeds of the Longi-Taormina Unit (Calabria-Peloritani Arc; southern Italy) have been mineralogically, chemically and petrographically analyzed, in order to reveal their complex history, which record an important phase of the geological evolution of the Mediterranean area. The Late Triassic corresponds with a low first-order sea level stand and a time of high continental emergence whereas the Early Jurassic was the time of the initiation of the first-order sea level rise in the mid-Mesozoic, generally marked by a transgressive trend. The mineralogical assemblage, dominated by the occurrence of illite and illite/smectite mixed layers, coupled to the CIA index and to the A-CN-K plot, indicates post-depositional K-enrichments. Palaeoweathering indices (CIW and PIA ratios) suggest that the source experienced intense weathering and that they likely record a recycling effect from their metasedimentary basement rocks. A recycling effect is also suggested by the distribution of Al2O3, TiO2, and Zr. In the Zr/Sc vs. the Th/Sc plot the redbeds are not clustered along the primary compositional trend but fall along a trend involving zircon addition and thus sediment recycling. Recycling could significantly affect the weathering indices which likely monitor a cumulative effect including a first cycle of weathering at the source rocks. Weathering occurred under hot, episodically humid climate with a prolonged dry season. Wet-humid conditions favored the formation of stream channels that eroded the soil profiles, whereas the dry season promoted the sedimentation. The climate alternation in the Early Jurassic favored recycling. An additional provenance terrane occurring in the basement, including metavolcanic rocks having mafic composition cannot be excluded, since the Eu anomaly is slightly higher than the PAAS value. Although the effects of recycling on REE distribution are uncertain, the Eu/Eu* should increase, as more feldspar is destroyed during weathering and diagenesis. This involves that the Eu/Eu* ratio could monitor a supply of low Eu/Eu* mafic detritus which compensate for the recycling effect by reducing Eu/Eu*. Eu released during the dissolution of feldspar could be retained by clay minerals contributing to minimize the recycling induced increase of the Eu-anomaly. This may involve that the recycling effect on the Euanomaly was minor and that the low Eu/Eu* mafic detritus supply was also minor.

	abstract = {The Nguba and Kundelungu Groups constitute the middle and upper parts of the Neoproterozoic Katangan Supergroup, respectively, and consist of conglomerates, sandstones, mudrocks and carbonates. During deposition, the Katangan basin received sediments originating from both northern and southern sources. The Nguba and Kundelungu Groups siliciclastic rocks have elemental abundances and ratios suggestive of a relatively felsic TTG source, although slightly more mafic compositions occur in the Nguba Group and the overlying “Petit Conglomérat” Formation at the base of the Kundelungu Group. Modal compositions of the Nguba Group rocks indicate a basement uplift provenance, and geochemical parameters indicate the source of both the Nguba and Kundelungu Groups had an active continental margin character. Source area weathering was moderate in the Nguba Group. Low Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) indices and relatively uniform chemical compositions of the “Grand Conglomérat” and the “Petit Conglomérat” Formations lying respectively at the bases of the Nguba and Kundelungu Groups are compatible with deposition in a cool or frigid climate, and support their presumed petrographic based glaciogenic origin. High CIA and PIA indices in Upper Kalule rocks in the middle part of the Kundelungu Group point to the intensification of source weathering, possibly under tropical to subtropical climate under steady state conditions. Geochemical similarities between the Nguba Group and the “Petit Conglomérat” are compatible with a change from an extensional setting to compression, with derivation of the “Petit Conglomérat” by reworking of the underlying units during basin inversion. Change in provenance signatures and weathering indices in the Upper Kalule Formation may reflect reduced tectonism and resumption of supply of more weathered extrabasinal detritus, similar to that which fed the basal Roan Group. Overall the data suggest derivation mainly from pre-Katangan Proterozoic sources with continental arc characteristics. The adjacent Paleoproterozoic Ubendian Belt, particularly the Bangweulu block calcalkaline plutonic and volcanic province, is a suitable candidate as the source for the Nguba and Kundelungu Group sedimentary rocks. However, Mesoproterozoic and Archaean terrains have also contributed a minor component to the basin.},

Although this rift may have been associated with the early stages in the breakup of Rodinia, it was not an aulacogen. Geochemical, Nd isotope, and detrital mode studies indicate that Uinta Mountain Group sediments were derived from mixed Archean and Paleoproterozoic sources with the former dominating. Big Cottonwood Group sediments appear to have been derived predominantly from Paleoproterozoic sources. The Archean sediment source is the Wyoming craton, and source rocks comprised dominantly granites enriched in Th, U, Y, Zr, Hf, and REE. The relative abundance of enriched granite implied by sedimentary rocks of the Uinta Mountain Group indicates that the Wyoming craton is anomalous compared to other Archean cratons. CIA values and A–CN–K relationships in shales of the Uinta Mountain and Big Cottonwood groups indicate high degrees of weathering of sources, probably in subtropical to tropical climates supporting a near-equatorial location for southwestern Laurentia at about 800Ma. Differences in the Nd isotopic composition between the Big Cottonwood Group and Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks in western Utah and northeast Nevada suggest a northwest-striking uplift in northwest Utah, possibly ancestral to the Paleozoic Toole–Uinta arch.},

	abstract = {This article presents new data to understand the nature of the hidden crystalline basement of northern Iran and the tectonic setting of Iran during late Neoproterozoic time. The siliciclastic-dominated Kahar Formation represents the oldest known exposures of northern Iran and comprises late Ediacaran (ca. 560–550 Ma) compositionally immature sediments including mudrocks, sandstones, and conglomerates. This work focuses on provenance of three well preserved outcrops of this formation in Alborz Mountains: Kahar Mountain, Sarbandan, and Chalus Road, through petrographic and geochemical methods. Mineralogical Index of Alteration (MIA) and Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA-after correction for K-metasomatism) values combined with A–CN–K relations suggest moderate weathering in the source areas. The polymictic nature of Kahar conglomerates indicates a mixed provenance for them. However, modal analysis of Kahar sandstones (volcanic to plagioclase-rich lithic arkose) and whole rock geochemistry of mudrocks suggest that they are largely first-cycle sediments and that their sources were remarkably late Ediacaran, intermediate-felsic igneous rocks from proximal arc settings. Tectonic setting discrimination diagrams also indicate a convergent plate margin and continental arc related basin for Kahar sediments. This interpretation is supported by the phyllo-tectic to tectic composition and geochemistry of mudrocks. These results reveal the presence of a felsic/intermediate subduction-related basement (∼600–550 Ma) in this region, which provides new constraints on subduction scenario during this time interval in Iran, as a part of the Peri-Gondwanan terranes.},

	abstract = {A complete Ediacaran–Early Cambrian stratigraphic transition can be observed in the southern part of the Central Iberian Zone (Iberian Massif). Two different stratigraphic units, underlying Ordovician series, display geochemical and Sm–Nd isotopic features in agreement with an evolving geodynamic setting. Pusa Shales (Early Cambrian) rest unconformably on greywackes of the Lower Alcudian Formation (Late Ediacaran). Both sequences present minor compositional variations for major and trace element contents and similar REE patterns, close to those of PAAS (Post Archean Australian Shale). Trace element contents and element ratios suggest mixed sources, with intermediate to felsic igneous contributions for both units. Tectonic setting discrimination diagrams for the Ediacaran greywackes indicate that these turbiditic series were deposited in a sedimentary basin associated with a mature active margin (volcanic arc). However, the compositions of the Cambrian shales fit better with a more stable context, a back-arc or retro-arc setting. εNd(T) and TDM ages are compatible with dominance of a similar cratonic source for both sequences, probably the West Africa Craton. εNd565 values for the Ediacaran greywackes (−3.0 to −1.4) along with TDM ages (1256–1334Ma) imply a significant contribution of juvenile material, probably derived from the erosion of the volcanic arc. However, εNd530 values in the Cambrian shales (−5.2 to −4.0) together with older TDM ages (1444–1657Ma), suggest a higher contribution of cratonic isotopic sources, probably derived from erosion of the adjacent mainland. Coeval with the progressive cessation of arc volcanism along the peri-Gondwanan realm during the Cambrian, there was a period of more tectonic stability and increasing arrival of sediments from cratonic areas. The geochemistry of the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition in Central Iberia documents a tectonic switch in the periphery of Gondwana, from an active margin to a more stable context related to the onset of a passive margin.},

Sandstone petrography and detrital modes indicates that the Late Palaeozoic succession was derived from craton interior and recycled orogen provenance. Sandstones in the Madzaringwe Formation are sub-arkosic to sub-litharenite. The sediments may represent a recycled to craton interior provenance. The geochemical data of major elements show that sandstone and shales have the same source. The study of paleoweathering conditions based on modal composition, chemical index of alteration (CIA) and A-CN-K (Al2O3-CaO+Na2O-K2O) relationships indicate that probably chemical weathering in the source area and recycling processes have been more important in shale and sandstone rocks. The relatively high CIA values (70–90\%) indicates moderate to high weathering conditions of the samples and the paleoclimate of the source area was warm. K2O/Na2O versus SiO2 and Na2O-CaO-K2O tectonic setting discrimination plots, suggest a passive continental margin. In the study of trace elements, triangular Th-Sc-Zr/10 and La-Th-Sc plots both suggest a passive margin setting of the basin. Petrographic and geochemical results of the samples suggest uplifted basement source areas dominated by sedimentary rocks and/or granite-gneiss rocks. The source rocks might have been the recycled pre-Soutpansberg Karoo Supergroup rocks and the metasedimentary rocks of the Soutpansberg Group. Other source rocks may have been the pre-Beit-Bridge basement rocks (granites and gneisses).},

An integrated approach incorporating detailed field observation and measurement, framework petrography, whole-rock geochemistry and detrital zircon U–Pb geochronology is applied here to investigate this problem. The framework petrography and whole-rock geochemical characteristics jointly suggest that the Zhesi Formation was derived primarily from felsic upper continental crust, with the source rocks undergoing intermediate weathering and short-distance transportation. Furthermore, the source rocks were composed of granites/granitoids that occurred in a transitional recycled orogen. LA–ICP-MS U–Pb detrital zircon data from sandstone samples show two main age groups of 480–410 and 290–265 Ma. Accordingly, we deduce that the dominant provenance of the Zhesi Formation was northerly early to mid-Palaeozoic orogenic belt, late Palaeozoic granites/granitoids and volcanics, with a possible contribution from the Hunshandake Block. The subsiding depositional environment of this succession is in response to the Middle Permian extensional tectonic setting of the orogenic belt. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fluvial, alluvial, lacustrine, and debris flow sedimentary rocks from the Keweenaw Peninsula (Michigan, USA) are geochemically characterized to examine weathering processes and provenance. These sedimentary rocks result from the erosion, weathering, and redistribution of effusive and plutonic igneous lithologies during periods of volcanic quiescence associated with the failed 1.1Ga North American Midcontinental Rift. Three units comprising the sedimentary/igneous-mixed Portage Lake Volcanics, coarseness and source-varied Copper Harbor Conglomerate, and the quartz-rich post-rift fill unit of the Jacobsville Sandstone were studied over a geographically-wide and lithologically-varied range of localities across the Keweenaw Peninsula, Michigan. Provenance indicators such as Ti/Zr and Ti/Al ratios and La-Th-Sc ternary diagrams reveal that the Portage Lake Volcanic conglomerates are near-source, and that the Copper Harbor Conglomerate is primarily derived from felsic uplifted basement and recycled orogen lithologies to the east. The Jacobsville Sandstone is a combination of pulses of sources from the top to the bottom of the stratigraphic section: (1) felsic arkosic arenites sourced from the erosion and uplift of basement orogenic volcanic and plutonic rocks (top), (2) felsic arkosic-subarkosic arenites sourced from the erosion of uplifted basement, recycled orogeny and reworking of primary sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks (middle), and (3) quartz arenites eroded from the cratonic interior (highly mature). This work can consequently aid in structuring a stratigraphic nomenclature for the Jacobsville Sandstone. Both petrographic data and weathering indices such as the chemical index of alteration (CIA) and the paleosol hydrolysis metric (Al/Ca+Na+Mg+K) indicate low degrees of weathering during syn-rift deposition at 1.1Ga, but increases with evolution of the rift in post-rift units toward the Late Mesoproterozoic/Early Neoproterozoic. Values for the CIA throughout the Mesoproterozoic from this and other localities have the same trend to that of proposed atmospheric CO2 concentrations derived from paleosol data, demonstrating that characterizing the weathering trends of floodplain deposits can be a useful addition to deciphering past paleoclimatic conditions in the Precambrian geologic record.},

The Um Zariq Formation metasediments are relicts of an old sedimentary sequence (Cryogenian; 813±6Ma), whereas the Malhaq Formation records several phases of Ediacaran sedimentation and volcanic activity (615–607Ma). The Um Zariq Formation is mainly represented by well-bedded metapelitic schists, while the Malhaq Formation comprises a series of structureless to schistose felsic to intermediate metavolcanics interbedded with mica-rich phyllites and schists. The Um Zariq metasediments are depleted in SiO2, CaO and K2O and enriched in TiO2, Al2O3 and K2O relative to those of the Malhaq Formation. Aside from the relatively low Ni and Cr concentrations, compatible transition elements of these metasediments are comparable to average crustal contents. Except for marked Sr depletion, LILEs are around average continental crust values. Pronounced negative Nb–Ta anomalies and enrichment of Um Zariq samples in Th, U, Zr, Ti and Y relative to Malhaq ones are the main features of HFSEs. The REE patterns of all samples are parallel to sub-parallel LREE-enriched, with distinct negative Eu anomalies and weakly fractionated HREE segments. The source rocks of the Malhaq Formation metasediments underwent mild to moderate chemical weathering, whereas those of the Um Zariq Formation have suffered severe chemical weathering. These metasediments are predominately derived from felsic to intermediate igneous sources, with a particular slight addition from recycled sedimentary source to the Malhaq Formation metasediments. They are collectively geochemically immature and have suffered minor sedimentary recycling, with the experience of the Malhaq Formation metasediments from higher degree of sorting and reworking.

	abstract = {Northeast Junggar occupies an important position that links East Junggar and Chinese Altai. Numerous magmatic and sedimentary rocks of the Paleozoic in this area recorded the final amalgamation processes of East Junggar and Chinese Altai. This study analyzes the petrological and geochemical characteristics of sandstones and mudstones from the Early Carboniferous Nanmingshui formation in Northeast Junggar. The provenance and tectonic setting of these clastic rocks are discussed. Petrography indicates that the composition and texture maturity of the sandstones are low. The components of the sandstones are mainly volcanic fragments (61–87\%), feldspars (9–30\%), and monocrystalline quartz (2–18\%), with a few polycrystalline quartz and other minerals. Slice observation indicates that the majority of the volcanic fragments of sandstones are basic-intermediate volcanic rocks with a few dacite and felsic plutonic fragments. The detrital modes of the sandstones reflect that these sandstones are derived from undissected arcs. A low to moderate chemical index of alteration and the Al2O3–CaO*+Na2O–K2O diagram reflect a low to moderate weathering degree in the source area. Trace and rare earth element (e.g., La, Th, Hf, Sc, Cr, Co, and Eu) contents and their ratios suggest that the source rocks of the clastic rocks are intermediate-basic rocks with some felsic rocks. Compared with sandstones, the source rocks for mudstones are more felsic. The petrography and geochemistry characteristics of the clastic rocks suggest that the proximal Dulate arc should be the primary source area. Mixing calculations based on REE data suggest that approximately two-thirds of the sandstone fragments are intermediate-basic volcanic rocks. The contents of the major and trace elements, as well as the stratum features, of the clastic rocks manifest that these clastic rocks resemble sedimentary rocks in a back-arc basin. The formation of this back-arc basin is caused by the southward subduction of the Zaysan–Erqis Ocean.},

	abstract = {Petrological and geochemical characteristics of sandstones and shales from the Carboniferous Cerro Agua Negra Formation (Río Blanco basin, western Argentina) are discussed. The sandstones are mostly feldspathic litharenites with subordinate litharenites and lithic arkoses, and their modal compositions indicate two major sources. The first represents a recycled orogen and can be identified as the Protoprecordillera, a N–S trending mountainous area that separated the Paganzo and Río Blanco basins and that was a positive element at least up until the end of the Carboniferous. The second was further east, in the Sierras Pampeanas terrane. It consisted of a variety of metasedimentary and felsic plutonic crystalline rocks. The Protoprecordillera must have been crossed by transverse valleys that facilitated the transfer of Pampean terrigenous material towards the Río Blanco basin. A lack of volcanogenic sand suggests that the basin was open towards proto-Pacific in the west, rather than being separated from it by a magmatic arc as previously suggested. Bulk geochemical analysis of different lithological types (arenites, wackes and shales) demonstrates a strong relationship between texture and chemical composition of the rocks, even taking into account the immobile elements. The largest differences are between shales and arenites, while the wackes have intermediate compositions. The CIA (chemical index of alteration) indicates partial remobilisation of oxides from source rocks and enrichment of aluminium and potassium in the shales, which reflects their potassic clay mineral composition. Overall, siliciclastics of the Cerro Agua Negra Formation have a similar composition to the upper continental crust (with slight net enrichment of SiO2 in the arenites and of Al2O3 in the shales). Rare earth element profiles reflect terrigenous contributions, since they are enriched in light-REE, have a pronounced negative Eu anomaly and a relative depletion of the heavy-REE. The results show that discrimination plots commonly employed to infer provenance and tectonic setting from siliclastics are compromised where bulk chemical composition is strongly dependent on grain size and sorting.},

	abstract = {New petrographic, major and trace element, and isotopic age data are presented for four suites of rocks from the low- to medium-grade part of the South Indian Archaean craton in central Karnataka. Two suites are from the Peninsular Gneiss basement to the late Archaean Dharwar Supergroup, the third is a suite of Dharwar potassic rhyolites and the fourth is from the Chitradurga Granite which has intrusive contacts with the Dharwar Supergroup. The Chikmagalur Granite (granodiorite), which with its host gneisses forms part of the basement (Peninsular Gneiss) to the Dharwar Supergroup in the Bababudan basin, yields RbSr and Pb/Pb whole-rock isochron dates of 3080 ± 110 Ma and 3175 ± 45 Ma, respectively, an initial 87Sr86Sr ratio of 0.7013 ± 0.0009 and a μ1 value (238U204Pb) of 7.98. Host tonalitic gneisses to the Chikmagalur Granite give an RbSr whole-rock isochron date of 3060 ± 160 Ma with an initial 87Sr86Sr ratio of 0.7015 ± 0.0004 and a Pb/Pb whole-rock isochron date of 3190 ± 100 Ma with a model μ1 value of 8.00. A suite of granites and granodioritic-tonalitic gneisses (Chitradurga granitic rocks and gneisses) forming part of the Peninsular Gneiss basement to the Dharwar Supergroup west of the Chitradurga belt yields RbSr and Pb/Pb whole-rock isochron dates of 2970 ± 100 Ma and 3028 ± 28 Ma, respectively, with an initial 87Sr86Sr ratio of 0.7035 ± 0.0013 and a model μ1 value of 7.62. The suite of Dharwar acid volcanic rocks from north of Honnali defines a poorly fitted 207Pb206Pb linear array (MSWD 15.8) which gives an apparent age of 2565 ± 28 Ma and a model μ1 value of 7.46. The poor fit of this ‘isochron’ shows that a closed system was not maintained, a conclusion supported by high K abundances which are attributed to a syn- or post-magmatic ion exchange process. The Chitradurga Granite which intrudes the older rocks of the Dharwar Supergroup in the Chitradurga belt yields a well-fitted Pb/Pb whole-rock isochron date of 2605 ± 18 Ma with a model μ1 value of 7.68. The UPb relations in these suites from Karnataka are in marked contrast with the commonly severe U depletion and, consequently, unradiogenic Pb isotopic compositions observed in deeply eroded, high-grade Archaean gneiss terranes such as those bordering the North Atlantic. This contrast indicates that the cratonic rocks in central Karnataka represent a relatively high level in the original Archaean continental crust.},

The sandstones from TF are mainly greywackes, whereas those from AF are lithic arenite. SiO2 ranges from 51 to 68\%. Geochemically, the clastic sediments cluster into mafic element (MEP) and low mafic element (LMEP) populations. The MEP sediments, which include turbiditic facies sediment samples from the Larder Lake Group in the Kirkland Lake area, are characterized by elevated abundances of MgO ({\textgreater}5\%), Ni ({\textgreater}200 ppm), Cr ({\textgreater}400 ppm), Sc ({\textgreater}22 ppm), and FeO ({\textgreater}7.5\%) abundances; lower contents of incompatible elements, such as Th, U, Ta, Hf, Zr, and total REEs ({\textless}45 ppm); and lower contents of alkaline earth elements, Sr, Ba, and Cs, relative to the LMEP sediments. La/YbN ratios are ≤4.5, with Eu/Eu* ≥ 1. The LMEP sediments (which include samples from the Beatty, Dome, and Three Nations Lake formations in Timmins, the Kewagama Group, Noranda area, and Timiskaming Group in the Kirkland Lake area), however, show reverse abundance distributions. The geochemical gaps shown by the major and trace elements define two populations of sediments, suggesting contrasting provenances for them: the MEP sediments require a dominantly mafic and ultramafic (90\%) source with 10\% felsic contribution, whereas the LMEP sediments require a mixture of felsic (75\%) and mafic (25\%) rocks. This compositional distribution of the sediments is closely related to their tectonic environments. The MEP was formed in basins proximal to or within an active oceanic rift, consequently having ultramafic and mafic rocks as the major source. For the LMEP, calc-alkaline volcanic sequences formed in an island arc-like setting were the major source. These two contrasting volcanic-plutonic terranes were tectonically juxtaposed during late Archean collisional tectonics.},

This is due to the change in the dominant source rocks from andesite to dacite to granite-gneiss and sedimentary rocks. Similarly, an increase in total REE and a decrease in Eu anomaly is also seen in the associated mudrocks with the increase in total clay content. This correlation in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks suggests that the REE characteristics of terrigenous sedimentary rocks reflect the depositional tectonic setting of the basin. The oceanic island-arc-type graywackes are characterised by their lower total REE abundance, only slight enrichment of LREE over HREE, and the absence of a negative Eu anomaly on chondrite-normalised plots. The continental island arc type graywackes are discriminated by their higher REE abundance and La/Yb ratio, the presence of a small negative Eu anomaly on the chondrite normalised plots and the significant enrichment of Eu compared to PAAS (Post-Archean Average Australian Shale). The sedimentary rocks deposited on Andean-type active continental margins, passive margins, platform and cratonic basins are all characterised by the high enrichment of LREE over HREE and the presence of a pronounced negative Eu anomaly on chondrite-normalised plots and can not be discriminated from each other by REE patterns alone.},

	abstract = {Late Carboniferous–Early Triassic Pyeongan Supergroup, Korea, was deposited in paralic to nonmarine environments developed disconformably on a lower Paleozoic platformal sequence. Pyeongan Supergroup mudrocks show progressive upsection changes in major, trace, and rare earth element compositions. Mudrocks in the lower and middle parts of the Pyeongan Supergroup are strongly depleted in CaO and Na2O, while those in the upper part are enriched in these elements. In parallel with CaO and Na2O, the ratio of K2O/Al2O3 in the lower and middle sections is less than 0.3, while uppermost strata are enriched in K2O having K2O/Al2O3 ratios greater than 0.3. The index of compositional variability, a measure of compositional maturity, is less than 0.6 in the lower to middle section, whereas in the uppermost strata it is greater than 0.7. Similar trends are reflected in A–CN–K space. Compared to PAAS mudrocks of the Pyeongan Supergroup (except for those in uppermost units), they are depleted in Mn, Ca, and Na and are slightly depleted in Mg and P. Contrasting major oxide trends between the lower and middle parts of the Pyeongan and the uppermost units are due to decreasing proportions of clay minerals and a concomitant increase in the proportion of nonclay silicate minerals due to increasing input of first-cycle detritus. Excursions marked by increases in MgO, Na2O, and CaO reflect large-scale input of nonclay first-cycle minerals from crystalline source rocks due to large-scale basement uplift. Incompatible elements are generally enriched in mudrocks of the Pyeongan Supergroup relative to PAAS, while transition metals (Co, Ni, Cr, and V) are progressively depleted in younger parts of the section. Total rare earth element concentrations are higher than PAAS, but chondrite-normalized patterns display the typical LREE-enriched pattern of PAAS. Eu anomalies for most mudrocks are close to that of PAAS. The youngest mudrocks in the Pyeongan Supergroup have the most negative values. These trends can be explained by a sedimentary system dominated by detritus derived from recycled highly weathered granitic materials in the lower to middle Pyeongan section, with an increased proportion of less weathered detritus derived from fractionated granitic materials in uppermost strata. Such an interpretation is consistent with the results of studies on coarse-grained sediments of the Pyeongan Supergroup.},

	abstract = {The modern Junggar Basin was located in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) during the Devonian and Carboniferous. Few data concerning the weathering, provenance and tectonic setting of the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in the Junggar Basin have been published. The recent discovery of an oil–gas field in the East Junggar Basin provides the impetus for this study. Twenty-eight sediment samples were recovered from eight boreholes, and all were analysed for major and trace element geochemistry. Two samples of sedimentary rocks were selected for zircon U–Pb dating. Low chemical index of alteration (CIA) values (44–71) and relatively high index of compositional variability (ICV) values (0.72–1.83) suggested weak chemical weathering and an immature source for these samples. The relatively low Th/U (2.16–10.55) and Rb/Sr (0.03–5.44) ratios of the drill core samples reflect a simple recycling history. Two samples indicated upper Carboniferous ages (314.6Ma) and a lower-middle Devonian age (397.9Ma). Geochemistry and detrital zircon geochronology from the East Junggar Basin reveal a distinct difference in the composition and source rock ages of clastic rocks from the lower and the upper Carboniferous. Major and trace element compositions of the lower Carboniferous sedimentary rocks (LCRs) were derived from typical mafic rocks and an intermediate ocean island arc of early to middle Devonian age, whereas the upper Carboniferous sedimentary rocks (UCRs) were derived from a continental island arc or active continental margin setting with a dominantly felsic to intermediate late Carboniferous age. The current data provide little support for tectonic models that show a passive continental margin of a Precambrian crystalline basement; our study suggests that a volcanic arc accretion or archipelago (early Carboniferous to early-middle Devonian) model for the East Junggar Basin is more viable.},

	abstract = {The Beishan orogenic belt, which connects the Tianshan suture on the west and Solonker suture on the east, contains key evidence for the termination time of the southern Altaids. Critical for evaluating different controversial tectonic models are Permian marine volcaniclastic arenites in the Liuyuan and Heishankou areas, which are dominated by greywackes and lenticular pebbly litharenites that contain grading, groove marks, and erosional bases, which provide evidence of turbidity action. Sandstones from the Liuyuan section are dominated by angular basaltic, andesitic, and feldspar fragments, but sandstones from the Heishankou section mainly consist of andesitic and felsic volcanic fragments. These relations suggest derivation from two different sources. Major element compositions suggest that the source rocks of the Heishankou litharenites were more SiO2-rich than those at Liuyuan. Sandstones at Heishankou are characterized by lower Ni–Co–Cr–V and slightly higher Th and La contents than those at Liuyuan. This indicates that the litharenites in the Liuyuan and Heishankou areas were derived from intermediate-mafic and intermediate-felsic source rocks, respectively. Tectonic setting discrimination plots suggest that the Liuyuan sandstones were deposited as detritus from an oceanic island arc, but the Heishankou sediments from an Andean continental margin. Our petrological and geochemical data from these two types of Permian turbidites suggest that an arc-continent collision took place in the Early Permian, and this is consistent with the Permian termination of the southern Altaids.},

	abstract = {Lower Paleozoic moderately sorted quartz–arenites from the Balcarce Formation deposited in eastern Argentina (Tandilia System) comprise mainly detrital material derived from old upper crustal material. The sources were magmatic, sedimentary, and subordinated felsic metamorphic terranes. High concentrations of tourmaline and Ti-rich heavy minerals, including zircon and nearly euhedral chromite, are common. Trace element concentrations (Nb, Cr) on rutile indicate pelitic and metabasaltic sources, respectively. Major element analyses on chromites indicate a basic volcanic protolith of mid-oceanic ridge origin, which was exposed close to the depositional basin. The delivery of chromite may be associated with convergent tectonics causing the consumption and obduction of oceanic crust during pre-Upper Ordovician times. The oblique/orthogonal collision of the Precordillera Terrane with the western border of the Rio de la Plata Craton, west of the Balcarce Basin or source further to the east from a Lower Palaeozoic extensional basin are possibilities. Geochemical and petrographic data exclude the underlying Precambrian and Cambrian sedimentary rocks as dominant sources, and favour the basement of the Río de La Plata Craton, including Cambrian rift-related granites of South Africa and the Sierras Australes (eastern Argentina), as main suppliers of detritus. Trace element geochemistry of recycled pyroclastic material, associated with the quartz–arenites, also suggests volcanic arc sources. The provenance of the pyroclastic material may either be the Puna–Famatina arc, located in north and central Argentina, or a hypothetical active margin further to the south. These ash layers are equivalent in age to volcanic zircons found in the Devonian Bokkeveld Group in western South Africa. The deposition of a glacial diamictite of Hirnantian age (Sierra del Volcán Diamictite) is interpreted as a member of the Balcarce Formation. Based on the stratigraphic re-location of the glacial diamictite and trace fossils, the Balcarce Formation is considered here to be Ordovician to Silurian in age. The Balcarce Formation can be correlated with similar rocks in South Africa, the Peninsula Formation, and the upper Table Mountain Group (Windhoek and Nardouw subgroups), including the Hirnantian glacial deposit of the Pakhuis Formation.},

	abstract = {The ∼2.7Ga Sandur Superterrane (SST), of the western Dharwar craton, is a collage of greenstone terranes having distinct lithotectonic associations; volcanic associations are prevalent. Fine-grained metasedimentary rocks, which are optimal for provenance studies, are sparse in greenstone terranes of this craton. However, extensive shale sequences are present in the eastern volcanic terrane (EVT) and the eastern felsic volcanic terrane (EFVT) of the SST. Within the EVT, the black shales are stratigraphically associated with black cherts, metabasalt and banded iron formation (BIF), and underlain by greywackes. Shales have compositions of tholeiitic basalt in terms of TiO2, Cr, Co, Ni, V, and Sc contents, and plot near the arc basalt endmember on the Th/Sc versus Sc mixing hyperbola. In contrast, Archean average upper continental crust of Taylor and McLennan [Taylor, S.R., McLennan, S.M., 1985. The Continental crust: Its Composition and Evolution. Blackwell, Oxford, 307p.; Taylor, S.R., McLennan, S.M., 1995. The geochemical evolution of the continental crust. Rev. Geophys.33, 241–265], plots mid-hyperbola indicative of bimodal arc magma provenance. Accordingly, the Sandur shales likely had a catchment in an oceanic arc or back-arc dominated by tholeiitic basalts. Specifically, Nb/Th ratios 1.5–2.5 in shales are close to those of Archean arc basalts (1–4), so a plateau or ocean island basalt source, where Nb/Th {\textgreater}8, can be ruled out. Compositionally, cherts are shale highly diluted by silica, with positive Eu anomalies, and are interpreted to be hydrothermal sediments precipitated from reduced fluids during periods of limited siliciclastic input. In the shales, variable SiO2 and Fe2O3 contents, depletions of MnO, MgO, and Na2O, and positive to negative Eu anomalies, but gains of K relative to arc basalt compositions, are interpreted as due to hydrothermal alteration. Greywackes underlying the shales have two compositions. Type I is similar to the shales, whereas Type II has fractionated REE with negative Eu anomalies consistent with a cratonic granitoid catchment [Manikyamba, C., Naqvi, S.M., Moeen, S., Gnaneswar Rao, T., Balaram, V., Ramesh, S.V., Reddy, G.L.N., 1997a. Geochemical heterogeneities of metagreywackes from the Sandur schist belt: implications for active plate margin processes. Precambrian Res. 84, 117–138]. Collectively, the results are in keeping with an intraoceanic arc outboard of a continental margin. During transgression the trench has a low energy shale facies with dominant arc contribution, but for regression high energy greywackes are deposited from a cratonic provenance.},

	abstract = {Fifty-eight rock chips from fifteen samples of sedimentary rocks from the Ramah Group (∼1.9 Ga) in northeastern Labrador, Canada, were analyzed for major and minor elements, including C and S, to elucidate weathering processes on the Earth's surface about 1.9 Ga ago. The samples come from the Rowsell Harbour, Reddick Bight, and Nullataktok Formations. Two rock series, graywacke-gray shales of the Rowsell Harbour, Reddick Bight and Nullataktok Formations, and black shales of the Nullataktok Formation, are distinguishable on the basis of lithology, mineralogy, and major and trace element chemistry. The black shales show lower concentrations than the graywackes-gray shales in TiO2 (0.3–0.7 wt\% vs. 0.7–1.8 wt\%), Al203 (9.5–20.1 wt\% vs. 13.0–25.0 wt\%), and ΣFe ({\textless}1 wt\% vs. 3.8–13.9 wt\% vs FeO). Contents of Zr, Th, U, Nb, Ce, Y, Rb, Y, Co, and Ni are also lower in the black shales. The source rocks for the Ramah Group sediments were probably Archean gneisses with compositions similar to those in Labrador and western Greenland. The major element chemistry of source rocks for the Ramah Group sedimentary rocks was estimated from the Al2O3TiO2 ratios of the sedimentary rocks and the relationship between the major element contents (e.g., SiO2 wt\%) and Al2O3TiO2 ratios of the Archean gneisses. This approach is justified, because the Al/Ti ratios of shales generally retain their source rock values; however, the Zr/Al, Zr/Ti, and Cr/Ni ratios fractionate during the transport of sediments. The measured SiO2 contents of shales in the Ramah Group are generally higher than the estimated SiO2 contents of source rocks by ∼5 wt\%. This correction may also have to be applied when estimating average crustal compositions from shales. Two provenances were recognized for the Ramah Group sediments. Provenance I was comprised mostly of rocks of bimodal compositions, one with SiO2 contents ∼45 wt\% and the other ∼65 wt\%, and was the source for most sedimentary rocks of the Ramah Group, except for black shales of the Nullataktok Formation. The black shales were apparently derived from Provenance 11 that was comprised mostly of felsic rocks with SiO2 contents ∼65 wt\%. Comparing the compositions of the Ramah Group sedimentary rocks and their source rocks, we have recognized that several major elements, especially Ca and Mg, were lost almost entirely from the source rocks during weathering and sedimentation. Sodium and potassium were also leached almost entirely during the weathering of the source rocks. However, significant amounts of Na were added to the black shales and K to all the rock types during diagenesis and/or regional metamorphism. The intensity of weathering of source rocks for the Ramah Group sediments was much higher than that of typical Phanerozoic sediments, possibly because of a higher Pco2 in the Proterozoic atmosphere. Compared to the source rock values, the Fe2+Ti ratios of many of the graywackes and gray shales of the Ramah Group are higher, the Fe2+/Ti ratios are lower, and the ΣFe/Ti ratios are the same. Such characteristics of the Fe geochemistry indicate that these sedimentary rocks are comprised of soils formed by weathering of source rocks under an oxygen-rich atmosphere. The atmosphere about 1.9 Ga was, therefore, oxygen rich. Typical black shales of Phanerozoic age exhibit positive correlations between the organic C contents and the concentrations of S, U, and Mo, because these elements are enriched in oxygenated seawater and are removed from seawater by organic matter in sediments. However, such correlations are not found in the Ramah Group sediments. Black shales of the Ramah Group contain 1.7–2.8 wt\%o organic C, but are extremely depleted in ΣFe ({\textless} 1 wt\% as FeO), S ({\textless}0.3 wt\%), U (∼1 ppm), Mo ({\textless}5 ppm), Ni ({\textless}2 ppm), and Co (∼0 ppm). This lack of correlation, however, does not imply that the ∼1.9 Ga atmosphere-ocean system was anoxic. Depletion of these elements from the Ramah Group sediments may have occurred during diagenesis.},

	abstract = {Approximately 100 pelite and 12 quartzite samples from the Ventersdorp ({\textasciitilde}2.7 Ga) and Transvaal Supergroups ({\textasciitilde}2.6–2.1 Ga) have been analyzed to monitor the early Proterozoic evolution of the Kaapvaal Craton, southern Africa. From oldest to youngest, pelites were sampled from the Ventersdorp-Bothaville (BOT), Transvaal-Selati (SEL), Black Reef (BR), Timeball Hill (TH), Strubenkop (STR), and Silverton (SIL) Formations. Paleocurrent measurements in Transvaal quartzites indicate sources lying predominantly to the north and east. Relative to the BOT-SEL-BR, pelites from the TH-STR-SIL are enriched in heavy-REE, LILE, Zr, Hf, Nb, and Ta, depleted in K2O, MgO, Ni, and Cr, and have lower Cr/Zr, Sc/Th, K2O/Na2O, and K/ Rb ratios. Compared to SEL-BR, BOT-TH-STR-SIL pelites have higher light-REE contents and La/Yb ratios, and lower Eu/Eu∗ ratios (0.61–0.66). Relative to NASC (North American Shale Composite), THSTR-SIL pelites are enriched in light-REE, Th, U, Ta, Nb, Sc, Cs, have higher La/Yb ratios, and are depleted in K2O and MgO. BOT-SEL-BR pelites are enriched in K2O, MgO, Cr, and Ni, have higher K2O/Na2O, Sc/Th, and Eu/Eu∗ ratios, and are depleted in Th, U, heavy-REE, and High Field Strength Elements (HFSE) relative to NASC. Compositions of TH-STR-SIL pelites suggest a provenance similar to average Phanerozoic uppercontinental crust. This source is more evolved than that of BOT-SEL-BR pelites, indicating a transformation from primitive (mafic-rich) to evolved (felsic-rich) upper-crust at 2.2 Ga. This transition follows earlier primitive to evolved trends in Moodies-Pongola (3.3-3.0 Ga) and Witwatersrand ({\textasciitilde}2.8 Ga) successions. These data suggest that several cycles of changing upper-continental crust occurred in the Kaapvaal craton between 3.3-2.1 Ga.},

Cr, Co and Ni are enriched in all Witwatersrand shales and Fe and Mg are high in shales from the West Rand Groups (WRG) and lower Central Rand Group (CRG). Shales from the CRG and uppermost WRG are enriched in Na, Al, LILE, REE, HFSE and transition metals relative to shales from the lower WRG. Chondrite-normalized REE patterns for all Witwatersrand shales are enriched in light-REE and exhibit small to moderate negative Eu anomalies. A positive correlation of REE and Al2O3 contents in the shales suggests that REE are contained principally in clay minerals. Relative to shales from the CRG, shales from the WRG exhibit depletions of Na, Ca and Sr, a feature probably reflecting intense chemical weathering of their source rocks. CIA indices in Witwatersrand shales are variable (chiefly 70–98), even within the same shale unit. Such variations reflect chiefly variable climatic zones or rates of tectonic uplift in source areas with perhaps some contribution from provenance and element remobilization during metamorphism. Compared to present-day upper continental crust, all but the Orange Grove, Roodepoort, and K8 shales appear to have been derived from continental sources depleted in LILE, REE, and HFSE and enriched in transition metals. Computer mixing models based on six relatively immobile elements (Th, Hf, Yb, La, Sc, Co) and four source rocks indicate that the relative proportions of granite, basalt and komatiite increased with time in sediment source areas at the expense of tonalite. The contributions of basalt and komatiite appear to reach a maximum during deposition of the Booysens shale, and granite during deposition of the K8 shales and possibly during deposition of the Orange Grove shales.},

The sediments of the Upper Birimian group were analyzed for their major and trace elements concentrations and their Nd–Sr isotopic compositions. The shales are enriched in Al2O3 and K2O relative to PAAS and depleted in the other mobile major elements and LILE whereas the fe-shales show enrichments in CaO and MnO and depletions in Al2O3 and K2O relative to PAAS but have similar depletion in LILE. Together with the subarkose samples, the shales have undergone significant post-depositional K metasomatism as indicated in the A–CN–K diagram. The calculated pre-metasomatism CIA values (83–92) indicates a high degree of source weathering compatible with steady-state weathering under tropical to subtropical conditions. The fe-shales have lower CIA values (46–57) reflecting less intense weathering conditions. Low Eu anomalies and Th/Sc ratios combined with high Cr/Th ratios for certain samples indicate a significant input of basic detritus for the analyzed sediments. Provenance modeling indicates that the shales are best modeled with a mixture having 75\% basalt (75B) and 25\% granite (25G). The fe-shales have a similar provenance with their compositions being modeled with a 80B 20G mixture. The ɛNd values of selected shales, calculated at 2.1Ga, the age of the deposition, vary from −2.8 to −8.6, which indicate that the sediment received 60–100\% of its detritus from a juvenile Birimian volcanic arc. Therefore, the Birimian sediments deposited within an active continental margin setting mostly supplied by the adjacent volcanic arc.},

	abstract = {The Cadomian basement and the Cambro-Ordovician overstep sequence in Saxo-Thuringia is characterized by clastic sedimentation from the Late Neoproterozoic to the Ordovician. Magmatism in the Avalonian–Cadomian Arc preserved in Saxo-Thuringia occurred between ca. 570 and 540 Ma. Peri-Gondwanan basin remnants with Cadomian to Early Palaeozoic rocks are exposed as very low-grade metamorphosed rocks in six areas (Schwarzburg Anticline, Berga Anticline, Doberlug Syncline, North Saxon Anticline, Lausitz Anticline, and Elbe Zone). A hiatus in sedimentation between 540 and 530 Ma (Cadomian unconformity) is related to the Cadomian Orogeny. A second gap in sedimentation occurred during the Upper Cambrian (500 to 490 Ma) and is documented by a disconformity between Lower to Middle Cambrian rocks and overlying Tremadocian sediments. Major and trace-element signatures of the Cadomian sediments reflect an active margin (“continental arc”), those of the Ordovician sediments a passive margin. The Cambrian sediments have inherited the arc signature through the input of relatively unaltered Cadomian detritus. Initial Nd and Pb isotope data from the six Saxo-Thuringian areas demonstrate that there is no change in source area with time for each location, but that there are minor contrasts among the locations. (1) Cadomian sediments from the Lausitz Anticline, the Doberlug Syncline and the Elbe Zone have lower 207Pb/204Pb than all other areas. (2) The core of the Schwarzburg Anticline, which is overprinted by greenschist facies conditions and detached, is isotopically heterogeneous. One part of its metasedimentary units has less radiogenic Nd than sediments from other low-grade units of similar age in the same area. (3) Cadomian sediments from the Schwarzburg Anticline show an input of younger felsic crust. (4) The Rothstein Group shows distinct input of young volcanic material. Also, (5) Cadomian sediments from the Lausitz Anticline, the Elbe Zone and parts of the North Saxon Anticline are characterized by input from an old mafic crust. Nd isotope data of the remaining areas yield average crustal residence ages of the sediment source of 1.5–1.9 Ga, which suggests derivation from an old craton as found for other parts of the Iberian–Armorican Terrane Collage. Similarly, the Pb isotope data of all areas indicate sediment provenance from an old craton. The rapid change of lithologies from greywacke to quartzite from the Late Neoproterozoic (Cadomian basement) to the Ordovician does not reflect changes in sediment provenance, but is essentially due to increased reworking of older sediments and old weathering crusts that formed during various hiatus of sedimentation. This change in sediment maturity takes its chemical expression in lower overall trace-element contents in the quartzite (dilution effect by quartz) and relative enrichment of some trace-elements (Zr, MREE, HREE due to detrital zircon and garnet). The Rb–Sr systematics of the quartzites and one Ordovician tuffite was disturbed (most likely during the Variscan Orogeny), which suggests a lithology-controlled mobility of alkali and calc-alkali elements. By comparison with available data, it seems unlikely that only Nd TDM model ages are useful to distinguish between West African and Amazonian provenance. Nd TDM model ages of 1.5 to 1.9 Ga in combination with paleobiogeographic aspects, age data from detrital zircon, and palaeogeographic constraints, especially through tillites of the Saharan glaciation in the Hirnantian, strongly indicate a provenance of Saxo-Thuringia from the West African Craton.},

	abstract = {The major and trace element characteristics of black shales from the Lower Cretaceous Paja Formation of Colombia are broadly comparable with those of the average upper continental crust. Among the exceptions are marked enrichments in V, Cr, and Ni. These enrichments are associated with high organic carbon contents. CaO and Na2O are strongly depleted, leading to high values for both the Chemical Index of Alteration (77–96) and the Plagioclase Index of Alteration (86–99), which indicates derivation from a stable, intensely weathered felsic source terrane. The REE abundances and patterns vary considerably but can be divided into three main groups according to their characteristics and stratigraphic position. Four samples from the lower part of the Paja Formation (Group 1) are characterized by LREE-enriched chondrite-normalized patterns (average LaN/YbN=8.41) and significant negative Eu anomalies (average Eu/Eu∗=0.63). A second group of five samples (Group 2), also from the lower part, have relatively flat REE patterns (average LaN/YbN=1.84) and only slightly smaller Eu anomalies (average Eu/Eu∗=0.69). Six samples from the middle and upper parts (Group 3) have highly fractionated patterns (average LaN/YbN=15.35), resembling those of Group 1, and an identical average Eu/Eu∗ of 0.63. The fractionated REE patterns and significant negative Eu anomalies in Groups 1 and 3 are consistent with derivation from an evolved felsic source. The flatter patterns of Group 2 shale and strongly concave MREE-depleted patterns in two additional shales likely were produced during diagenesis, rather than reflecting more mafic detrital inputs. An analysis of a single sandstone suggests diagenetic modification of the REE, because its REE pattern is identical to that of the upper continental crust except for the presence of a significant positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu∗=1.15). Felsic provenance for all samples is suggested by the clustering on the Th/Sc–Zr/Sc and GdN/YbN–Eu/Eu∗ diagrams. Averages of unmodified Groups 1 and 3 REE patterns compare well with cratonic sediments from the Roraima Formation in the Guyana Shield, suggesting derivation from a continental source of similar composition. In comparison with modern sediments, the geochemical parameters (K2O/Na2O, LaN/YbN, LaN/SmN, Eu/Eu∗, La/Sc, La/Y, Ce/Sc) suggest the Paja Formation was deposited at a passive margin. The Paja shales thus represent highly mature sediments recycled from deeply weathered, older, sedimentary/metasedimentary rocks, possibly in the Guyana Shield, though Na-rich volcanic/granitic rocks may have contributed to some extent.},

	abstract = {Shales of the Upper Cretaceous Hayang Group in the Yeongyang Subbasin, southeastern Korea were deposited in fluvio-lacustrine environments as the Paleo-Pacific (Izanagi) Plate obliquely subducted beneath the Asian continent. Major and trace element compositions derived from shales analyzed from the Hayang Group reveal geochemical signatures that are different from Post-Archean average Australian Shale (PAAS), but are typical of igneous rocks found in the continental-margin island arc settings. For example, most major element concentrations are depleted relative to PAAS; among them MgO and MnO depletions are most pronounced in all shales. CaO enrichment is notable in some formations due to the presence of secondary calcite as dispersed micro-calcite nodules. Sc, Y, and Th concentrations are also slightly depleted relative to PAAS while chondrite-normalized REE data for shales from the Hayang Group show moderate to large uniform LREE enrichment but variable HREE depletions. In addition, they are more fractionated than PAAS, and have significant negative Eu anomalies. Moreover, the chemical index of alteration and A–CN–K relations comply that the source area was dominated by non-steady state weathering regimes indicative of active uplift along an active continental margin. These regions were punctuated by two periods of steady-state weathering or alternatively by enhanced recycling of sediments. The latter interpretation is in accord with the timing of exposure of a cherty sequence in the source area. Mixing calculations based on REE data suggest that the average shale in the Hayang Group was derived from sources composed of Precambrian granitic gneiss, arc basaltic rocks, Triassic Yeongdeok Granite in the subbasin, and the Mino accretionary complex of SW Japan with ratios around 43.7 (31.8–73.2):26.4 (15.8–36.7):15.4 (2.8–33.9):14.5 (0.0–33.8).

	abstract = {The 1.9Ga Gwalior Group represents one of the major Paleoproterozoic depositional basin of Bundelkhand craton and is comprised of ∼1km thick unmetamorphosed and undeformed sedimentary succession, with basal clastic sequence of sandstone-shale association (Par Formation) and an upper chemogenic BIF rich sequence (Morar Formation). The geochemical examinations of the basal clastic rocks are the subject of present study. The compositional maturity and extreme quartz enrichment in sandstones of Gwalior Group suggest slow upliftment and high in situ weathering of basement terrains in a stable platformal setting. These clastic sediments are characterized by strong depletion of mobile constituents like Ca, Sr and Na, high Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values and strong positive correlation between Al2O3 and TiO2, indicating severe weathering of upper crust. Positive correlation between FeO(T) and TiO2 suggests Fe retention in paleoweathering profiles and is attributed to oxygenated atmosphere. Post depositional potash metasomatism is indicated in A-CN-K systematics of these sediments and K-enrichment from near zero to as high as 38\% is inferred, with most of the shale samples show ∼30\% extraneous K2O additions. Depleted transition element (Ni, Cr, Co, Sc) contents, elevated large ion lithophile element (LILE) [K, Rb, Ba, Th, light rare earth elements (LREE)] contents, fractionated rare earth element (REE) patterns, strong negative Eu anomalies in these sediments point toward K-rich intracrustal granitic source component. Steeper REE patterns (Avg. La/YbN ∼12.57) compared to basement granites and conspicuous depletion of Y over other LILEs in AUC normalized spidergram also suggest a heavy rare earth element (HREE) depleted TTG source component. Minor contribution from tholeiitic mafic rock is evidenced from Th/Sc–Sc, La/Sc–Sc/Th systematics and positive correlation of transition elements with FeO(T) and TiO2. Mixing calculations on the REE data suggest that upper continental crust of Bundelkhand craton was constituted of 40\% granite, 40\% TTG and 20\% mafic rocks. This is in contrast with the present day composition of Bundelkhand Granite Gneiss Complex (BGGC) that contains ∼90\% high K granite. The data suggest unroofing of granite batholiths by means of erosion and upliftment of supracrustal TTG cover.},

REE concentrations of the Vindhyan shales are comparable to the upper continental crust. Various discriminant diagrams were used to reveal the inferred provenance, tectonics and paleoweathering conditions. A predominantly granitic source rock is inferred for the Lower Vindhyan Shales, whereas partial contribution from basaltic source is evident during deposition of the Upper Vindhyan Shales. Existing paleocurrent data and the present geochemical investigations together suggest Archean–Paleoproterozoic basement rocks, exposed beyond the southern basin margin of the Vindhyan outcrops as the possible source rocks. The deposition of the Vindhyan shales took place in an intracratonic basin where sediments were primarily derived from stable continental areas. Moderate climatic conditions are inferred during the deposition of the shales. The Upper Vindhyan Shales, however, reflect more intense weathering compared to the Lower Vindhyan Shales, which may be attributed to relative tectonic stability and more humid conditions during deposition of Upper Vindhyan Shales.},

	abstract = {Major and trace element data of the Permo-Triassic mudstones from the intracratonic Satpura Gondwana basin, central India have been used to investigate provenance. The Satpura succession ({\textasciitilde}5km thick) unconformably overlies the Precambrian basement. Sediment dispersal pattern suggests that the Precambrian rocks straddling the southern margin of the Satpura basin were the most probable source for the sediments. The lowermost unit of the Satpura succession comprises glacio-marine and glacio-fluvial deposits. The rest of the succession largely represents a variety of fluvial depositional systems with some records of fluvio-deltaic and fluvio-lacustrine sedimentation under a climatic spectrum of temperate, humid to warm, semi-arid. The present study is confined to the lower six formations namely Talchir, Barakar, Motur, Bijori, Pachmarhi and Denwa, arranged in that order from bottom to top. The oldest rocks of this sequence, the Talchir Formation, are enriched in mobile elements such as Na, Ca and Mg, depleted in alumina and have high ICV (0.93–1.29) and lower CIA values (61.82–74.89) compared to those of the younger mudstones. K2O/Al2O3 ratios of the Talchir mudstones (0.24–0.28) are higher than the younger mudstones in this sequence. These results suggest that the Talchir mudstones were weathered less intensely and are thus more immature than the younger mudstones. This is consistent with the prevailing cold climate and relatively higher rate of basin subsidence. In contrast, the majority of the mudstones from the younger formations are depleted in mobile elements, have relatively low ICV (0.18–0.87) and K2O/Al2O3 values (0.07–0.26), higher CIA values (76.99–92.86), and appear compositionally more mature reflecting moderate to high intensity source rock weathering. Among them, the Barakar mudstones likely have been more intensely weathered than mudstones from any of the other formations. The trace element compositions and ratios are consistent with most mudstones being derived from a felsic source with some mudstones being derived from a more mafic source. For example, La/Sc (0.805 and 0.114), La/Th (6.245, 5.072, 7.418, 6.245, and 5.072) and Eu/Eu* (1.431, 0.868, and 0.805) of some mudstones indicate mafic source. Bivariate plot of Th/Sc and Zr/Sc indicates considerable enrichment of zircon that suggests recycling from meta-sedimentary rocks. Prominent negative Eu anomaly, high LREE/HREE, and flat HREE pattern reflect sediment derivation from predominantly felsic rocks of the old upper continental crust. SiO2/Al2O3 versus K2O/Na2O plot for the mudstones suggests that they formed in a passive margin. Also, total REE content of most of the mudstones is conformable with passive margin tectonic setting and craton interior type of provenance. Plotting in La–Th–Sc, Th–Sc–Zr/10 and La/Sc versus Ti/Zr diagrams largely indicates continental margin settings for majority of the mudstones but fails to differentiate between active and passive continental margins.},

	abstract = {Bayana Basin, sited along the eastern margin of the north Delhi fold belt of the Aravalli Craton, contains an ∼3000 m-thick sequence comprising one volcanic and seven sedimentary formations of the Delhi Supergroup. The sedimentary units are the Nithar, Jogipura, Badalgarh, Bayana, Damdama, Kushalgarh, and Weir formations in order of decreasing age. Petrographic study of the sandstones as well as major and trace elements (including rare earth elements) and bulk-rock analyses of the shales and sandstones allow the determination of their provenance, source-rock weathering, and basinal tectonic setting. The sandstones are quartz rich and were derived mainly from exhumed granitoids typical of a craton interior. Geochemical patterns of the sandstones and shales are similar. However, trace element abundances are low in sandstones, probably due to quartz dilution. The coarser clastic Damdama and Weir sandstones, which occur at higher stratigraphic levels, have strikingly low trace element concentrations compared with the underlying Bayana and Badalgarh sandstones. All samples show uniform LREE-enriched patterns with negative Eu-anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.16–0.23) and are similar to those of post-Archaean Australian shales (PAAS). However, the (La/Yb) n ratios (averages 11–18) of all the sedimentary units are higher than those of PAAS, except for the Bayana Sandstone, which has low values (average 6.77). The chemical index of alteration (70–78) and the plagioclase index of alteration (87–97) values and the A–CN–K diagram suggest moderate to intense weathering of the source area. The provenance analyses indicate that basin sedimentation was discontinuous. It received input from a terrain comprising granitoids, mafic rocks, sedimentary sequences, and tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suites. The Nithar and Badalgarh sandstones received input from a source consisting predominantly of granitoids. The succeeding Damdama and Weir sandstones received debris from granitoids and TTG in different proportions. The Kushalgarh shale was possibly derived from a source consisting granites and mafic rocks with a TTG component. The pre-existing sedimentary formations also contributed intermittently during the different phases of sedimentation. Bulk-rock geochemical data suggest Mesoarchaean gneisses and late Archaean granites of BGC/BGGC (Banded Gneissic Complex/Bundelkhand Granitic Gneiss Complex) basement as possible source terrains. These data indicate deposition in a continental rift setting. The coeval formation of many rift-related Proterozoic sedimentary basins in the BGC/BGGC terrain suggests that the North Indian Craton underwent major intracratonic extension during Proterozoic time, probably triggering the break up of Earth's first supercontinent.},

	abstract = {Proterozoic sedimentary successions of India are important archives of both the tectonic history of the Indian subcontinent and the geochemical evolution of Earth surface processes. However, the lack of firm age constraints on many of these stratigraphic units limits their current utility. Here, we present new detrital zircon age data from strata of the southern Aravalli–Delhi Orogenic Belt (ADOB) and the Rajasthan Vindhyan successions. The Alwar Group of the southern Delhi Supergroup yielded a large population of ∼1.2Ga detrital zircon grains, which refutes the 1.9–1.7Ga age assertion for this unit. Detrital zircon age distributions from the southern Alwar Group differ strongly from the Alwar Group of the “North Delhi Belt”, demonstrating miscorrelation between these two regions. The Jhamarkotra Formation of the Lower Aravalli Group contains a large population of 1.9–1.7Ga detrital zircon grains. Therefore, the unit cannot be ∼2.1Ga as traditionally assumed. Age distributions of the Aravalli and Delhi supergroups are similar to those of the lower and upper Vindhyan successions, and we postulate contiguous sediment sources for both regions, with strata of the tectonically deformed ADOB representing the distal margin equivalents of the Vindhyan successions. Additionally, a late Paleoproterozoic age for the Jhamarkotra Formation nullifies the hypothesis that the markedly positive carbonate δ13C values in this unit are linked to the 2.3–2.0Ga Lomagundi–Jatuli positive isotope excursion. The potential of a large late Paleoproterozoic (ca. 1.7 Ga) positive δ13C excursion contrasts with the long-held view of a prolonged period of carbon isotope stasis during the so-called ‘boring billion’.},

	abstract = {The Kumbalgarh Group of the south Delhi fold belt are the main bedrock series exposed in the axial region of the Aravalli craton. Quartzites and greywackes, the chief clastic constituents of this group, are well exposed. Petrographic and bulk-rock analyses of these rocks permit determination of their provenance, tectonic setting of the basin, and the Archaean to Proterozoic crustal evolution. Greywackes comprise quartz, plagioclase, amphiboles, K-feldspar, and rock fragments. Based on mineralogy, we divided the quartzites into three categories: QTZ1 is chiefly composed of quartz with a silty matrix and a minor quantity of feldspars and QTZ2 contains significant mafic minerals as well as quartz and feldspars, whereas QTZ3 is more feldspathic than the other groups. All the lithounits have SiO2/Al2O3 ratios {\textless}∼10 suggesting textural immaturity consistent with their sedimentary petrography. Greywackes display the least fractionated rare earth elements (REEs) (La/Yb N : avg. 2.55) with positive Eu anomalies (avg. Eu/Eu* = 1.34). QTZ1 contains strongly fractionated REE patterns (avg. La/Yb N : 13.56, avg. Eu/Eu* = 0.60), QTZ2 shows moderate REE fractionation (avg. La/Yb N : 4.97, avg. Eu/Eu* = 0.61), and QTZ3 possesses the least fractionated V-shaped REE patterns (avg. La/Yb N : 1.97, avg. Eu/Eu* = 0.51). Weathering attributes including chemical index of alteration (CIA), plagioclase index of alteration (PIA), chemical index of weathering (CIW), and A–CN–K plots assign a low to moderate degree of weathering to the Kumbalgarh sediments under a subtropical climate. Based on our synthesis of the petrographic and geochemical data, we suggest a provenance comprising basalts, tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite (TTG), and granite. Geochemical attributes indicate deposition of the detritus in an extensional backarc basin receiving sedimentary input from opposite directions. The opening and then closure of the South Delhi Basin was the last phase of the break-up of the supercontinent, columbia, which began by abortive rifting of the Udaipur belt and culminated in separation of the Aravalli–Bundelkhand–Dharwar block in the east and the East African orogen in the west.},

	abstract = {Shales and mudrocks are enriched with diverse suites of major elements and trace metals that reflect their depositional environment, provenance and diagenesis. Here we present geochemical data for Devonian–Mississippian shaly strata (Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin) to assess the use of geochemical proxies for thermally mature deposits ({\textgreater}1.5\% vitrinite reflectance; VRo), and the ability to apply such proxies to elucidate the paleoceanographic conditions responsible for element distributions. Specifically, excess silica contents, C–S–Fe relationships, Ni/Co, V/Cr, Mo/Al and Re/Mo are utilized. Although regional in scope, the data presented here has broader implications for utilizing trace element geochemistry from geologic periods (Devonian–Mississippian) in which significant organic-rich sediment accumulation occurred, and subsequently underwent high levels of thermal diagenesis. Comparison of thermally mature lower Besa River, Golata, Muskwa and Fort Simpson shales ({\textgreater}2\% VRo for lower Besa River, and between 1.5\% and 2\% VRo for Golata, Muskwa and Fort Simpson), show that: 1) thermal maturation has had no effect upon the distribution of redox-sensitive elements (e.g., Ni, V, Mo, Tl, Cd and U); and 2) these elements are delivered to the sediment in association with the organic matter under anoxic (possibly euxinic) water-column conditions. Major element geochemistry (and optical microscopy) indicates organic-rich lower Besa River and Muskwa sediments are enriched in biogenic silica (proxied by excess SiO2 concentrations), hence the use of Si as a proxy of detrital quartz input must be used with caution. Excess Si concentrations could be used as paleoproductivity proxies in reducing sediments where elements such as P and Ba are mobilized and not retained in the sediments. Golata sediments also have high excess Si contents, but the enrichment of Ti, Nb, Th, Ce, Hf and La (detrital-proxying elements) relative to average shale implies a detrital source of the quartz. Organic-rich, sulfur-rich upper Besa River shales were deposited in anoxic conditions (based upon C–S–Fe and Re/Mo relationships), akin to lower Besa River and Muskwa shales. However, upper Besa River shales show no enrichment of redox-proxying elements Mo, U and V, indicating benthic anoxia was not a ubiquitous requirement for element sequestration. Thermal maturation levels are similar to that of lower Besa River shales; hence element loss through diagenesis is not implied. A possible explanation is differing sedimentation rates which can affect the diffusion and concentration of elements into the sediment, and subsequent authigenic enrichment. This behavior makes Mo, U and V of limited use as paleoredox proxies under these sedimentary conditions.},

The Early Carboniferous is interpreted to represent a compressional environment, followed by a Late Carboniferous molasse-type foreland basin, and a Permian extensional geodynamic setting. Contrasting geochemical patterns of post-Variscan and Permian sequences suggest a rift setting. Electron microprobe data of detrital white mica also indicate changes in the provenance. Compositional data reflect a shift from low- to medium-grade metamorphic (Ordovician) to high-grade metamorphic (Carboniferous) to low- to medium-grade metamorphic and plutonic source rocks (Permian). Additionally, our data show that various chemical discrimination diagrams do not include all possible ranges of sandstones, and that high contents of detrital mica and ultra-stable heavy minerals may cause misclassification. Consequently, we propose the use of multi-method approach for provenance studies, including the control of geochemical data by modal analysis and heavy mineral investigations.},

	abstract = {A succession of Devonian cover rocks occurs in outcrop and in the subsurface of central-northern Uruguay where they were deposited in an intracratonic basin. This Durazno Group comprises three distinct stratigraphic units, namely the Cerrezuelo, Cordobés and La Paloma formations. The Durazno Group does not exceed 300 m of average thickness and preserves a transgressive-regressive cycle within a shallow-marine siliciclastic shelf platform, and is characterized by an assemblage of invertebrate fossils of Malvinokaffric affinity especially within the Lower Devonian Cordobés shales. The sedimentary provenance of the Durazno Group was determined using petrography, geochemistry, and morphological studies of detrital zircons as well as their U–Pb ages. Sandstone petrography of Cerrezuelo and La Paloma sequences shows that they have a dominantly quartz-feldspathic composition with a minor contribution of other minerals. Whole-rock geochemical data indicate that alteration was strong in each of the three formations studied; chondritic-normalized REE patterns essentially parallel to PAAS, the presence of a negative Eu-anomaly, and Th/Sc and La/Hf ratios point to an average source composition similar to UCC or slightly more felsic. Within the Cerrezuelo Formation, recycling of older volcano-metasedimentary sources is interpreted from Zr/Sc ratios and high Hf, Zr, and REE concentrations. U–Pb detrital zircon age populations of the Cerrezuelo and La Paloma formations indicate that the principal source terranes are of Neoproterozoic age, but include also minor populations derived from Mesoproterozoic and Archean-Paleoproterozoic rocks. A provenance from the Cuchilla Dionisio-Dom Feliciano, Nico Pérez and Piedra Alta terranes of Uruguay and southern Brazil is likely. This study establishes an intracratonic extensional tectonic setting during Durazno time. Considering provenance age sources, regional paleocurrent distributions and the established orogenic history recorded in SW Gondwana, we suggest that the basin fill was derived from paleohighs located in what is currently SE Uruguay.},

The uniformity shown by the provenance proxies indicate that there were no important changes in the provenance within these units. A dominant upper crustal component is evident as well as a subordinate mafic input. Nd isotopes indicate εNd of −5.4, ƒSm/Nd −0.34 and TDM 1.57 Ga in average for all the units studied. Pb-isotope ratios display average values for 206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/204Pb of 19.37, 15.86 and 39.43 respectively. Detrital zircon dating further constraints the input as being dominantly of Mesoproterozoic age (51–83\%), but with contributions from Neoproterozoic–Lower Cambrian (9–31\%), Middle Cambrian to Ordovician grains (recorded up to 7\%), and Palaeoproterozoic (2–7\%) sources. The combination of the different provenance approaches applied indicates that the Mesoproterozoic Cuyania terrane basement, and partially the Pampia terrane were the main sources. The new information provided for the Ordovician to Silurian clastic sequences permitted enhanced the known geochemical and isotopic dataset to constrain the tectonic evolution of the Cuyania terrane. The interpretation of the obtained data supports that the terrane accretion to the proto-Andean margin of Gondwana probably occurred during Middle to early Upper Ordovician.},

	abstract = {U–Pb isotopic ages of single detrital zircons have been obtained from metasandstones in the northern part of the Pontiac subprovince and from the Cadillac, Kewagama and Lac Caste Groups within the southern Abitibi subprovince. Youngest detrital zircon ages from these sequences are 2685, 2686, 2687, and 2693 Ma, respectively. The Lac Fournière pluton, which intrudes Pontiac Group metasedimentary rocks, is dated at 2682±1 Ma. A similar age was previously measured from a pluton that cuts the Kewagama Group. These data bracket deposition of greywacke in the Pontiac and Abitibi subprovinces to 2685±3 Ma. In contrast, the youngest zircon found in a volcaniclastic unit interbedded with Timiskaming Group metawacke is 2673±2 Ma, while the age of a pluton that intrudes the Timiskaming is 2672±1 Ma. Thus, the Timiskaming Group is distinctly younger than the other metasedimentary rocks. The normalized probability distributions of detrital zircon ages from the Pontiac and the Abitibi metasedimentary rocks, as well as of dated igneous rocks from the southern Abitibi subprovince, all show that their major zircon populations formed in the age range 2685–2710 Ma. The distributions for the Abitibi metaturbidites and dated igneous rocks are very similar, suggesting that metasedimentary rocks in the Abitibi belt were mostly derived from the surrounding granite–greenstone terrain. The largest peak of the Pontiac distribution is a few million years younger than that from the Abitibi metasedimentary rocks but there is a correlation between major peaks and both groups show similar age ranges for older, pre-Abitibi components (2750–2850 and 3020–3030 Ma). Deposition of the ca. 2685 Ma sediments was virtually syn-deformational. Based on previous field, geochemical and isotopic studies, as well as the detrital zircon age data, the Pontiac Group may represent a foreland basin that may have developed from an accretionary prism. The source of much of the sediment may have been an uplifted extinct continental arc to the north. The arc was mostly eroded into the sediment basin and perhaps tectonically overridden by a southward advancing nappe complex comprised of its back arc basin, now partly preserved in the southern volcanic zone of the Abitibi subprovince. Metaturbidites exposed between metavolcanic assemblages within the greenstone belt may represent overturned unconformities at the structural base of the greenstones. These were brought up by high angle faults, which also localized deposition of non-marine (Timiskaming-type) sediments. It is tentatively suggested that Pontiac-type metasedimentary rocks extend most of the way beneath the Abitibi subprovince, the oldest part of the basin emerging as the Quetico Group in the western Superior province.},

	abstract = {The northwestern Pontiac Subprovince is dominated by a monotonous greywacke sequence, metamorphosed and deformed during the Late Archaean Kenoran orogeny. Limited chemical weathering of the source rocks is suggested by: (1) low values of the chemical index of alteration, (2) no preferential leaching of Ca, Sr and Ba, (3) well defined correlations among MgO, K2O and Al2O3, and (4) small variations of Cr/Ni. The source was dominantly felsic as indicated by high Th/Sc (average=0.39), La/Co (1.06), Zr/Cr (0.7), Zr/Y (11.2) and SiO2/MgO (19.4). The composition of these metasedimentary rocks can be modelled by mixing of three end-member components: (1) tonalites/trondhjemites (∼ 65\%) in order to explain the SiO2, Al2O3, Th, U, Zr, Sr, and Ba abundances, NaK ratios, strong depletion in HREE and HFSE relative to LREE and LILE, low Th, Y and K2O, and fractionated La/Yb (19.4), (2) komatiites (∼ 5\%) in order to explain the high Cr (220 ppm) and Ni (66 ppm) contents, and (3) tholeiitic basalts (∼ 30\%) accounting for the observed TiO2 (0.62 wt\%), V (144 ppm) and Sc (17 ppm) concentrations. The source region may be considered as a deeply eroded greenstone belt intruded by abundant tonalite-trondhjemite plutons; possibly now located to the south (and east) in the Grenville Province or possibly to the north, underlying the dominantly volcanic Abitibi Subprovince.},

These sections represent the siliciclastic sedimentary sequence from the Tethys Himalaya. The PTB siliciclastic sedimentary sequence in these regions primarily consists of sandstones and shales with variable thickness. Present studied sandstones and shales of both sections had chemical index of alteration values between 65 and 74; such values reveal low-to-moderate degree of chemical weathering. The chemical index of weathering in studied samples ranged from 71 to 94, suggesting a minor K-metasomatism effect on these samples. Plagioclase index of alteration in studied sections ranged from 68 to 92, indicating a moderate degree of weathering of plagioclase feldspars.

	abstract = {The Tarija Basin, shared by Bolivia and Argentina, was subjected to glacial conditions during the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian. The Macharetí and Mandiyutí groups deposited during these times record in their facies advances and retreats of the Gondwanan ice cap. The lithostratigraphic subdivision of these groups presents stages with minor glacial influence in the basal formations of each group (Tupambi and Escarpment formations), whereas in the upper units, glacially related deposition prevails (Tarija and San Telmo formations). Typical facies deposited in relation to glacial settings are diamictites and mudstones mainly related to proglacial, lacustrine environments. During the stages of main ice retreat, deposition was dominated by fluvial and deltaic sandstones. Significant erosion and deep valley incision characterize the basal surfaces of both groups. Conversely, the stratigraphic surface that separates the sandy formations from the overlying diamictites tends to be rather flat. The dynamics of the glacial cap are not only reflected in the facies distribution but also were a key factor in creating accommodation space; the changes in the glacial-driven subsidence linked to the advance and retreat of the ice were its main control.
Resumen
La Cuenca de Tarija, compartida por Argentina y Bolivia, estuvo sujeta a la acción glacial durante el Carbonífero Tardío y el Pérmico temprano. Los grupos Macharetí y Mandiyutí, depositados durante ese intervalo registran en sus facies los avances y retrocesos del casquete glacial Gondwánico. Así, la subdivisión litoestratigráfica de estos grupos refleja etapas con escasa influencia glacial en sus unidades basales (formaciones Tupambi y Escarpment) mientras que en las unidades superiores de los mismos predomina la depositación relacionada a glaciaciones (formaciones Tarija y San Telmo). Las facies típicas depositadas mientras la cuenca fue alcanzada por los casquetes glaciares fueron diamictitas y pelitas relacionadas a ambientes lacustres pro-glaciales. Durante los estadios de retroceso de los casquetes, la depositación estuvo dominada por areniscas de origen fluvial y deltaico. La superficie basal de cada uno de los grupos se caracteriza por presentar una erosión importante y por la incisión de profundos valles. Contrariamente, la superficie que separa las formaciones arenosas de las suprayacentes diamictíticas tiende a ser bastante plana. La dinámica del casquete glacial no sólo afectó la distribución de facies, sino que también condicionó el espacio de acomodación por medio de cambios en la subsidencia relacionados al peso del casquete.},

In eastern Canada, the Neoproterozoic Gaskiers Formation (Fm.) consists of a thick diamictite–turbidite succession (250–300 m thick) that occurs within the deep-marine predominantly volcaniclastic turbidite units of the Conception Group (4–5 km thick). These rocks are well exposed on the coast of the Avalon Peninsula in eastern Newfoundland. The thick succession is considered by some to represent the final Neoproterozoic glacial event, known as the Gaskiers Glaciation c. 582–585 Ma. The Gaskiers Fm. appears to have accumulated in a volcanically-influenced arc-related basin within the confines of the Proterozoic peri-Gondwanan Avalon terrane, before rifting away from the Gondwanan margin in the early Palaeozoic, but it is not clear whether it was adjacent to the West African Craton or the Amazon Craton. It has also been argued that Avalon had already rifted from Gondwana by the late Proterozoic.
Glacially striated clasts, dropstones, and chatter-marked garnets identify a glaciated source area, and clasts and matrix are of volcanic origin; pyroclastic flows and volcanic bombs are also present. As a result, there is a growing consensus that the Gaskiers Fm. records local glaciation of a high relief volcanic topography, owing its origin to the episodic downslope reworking of volcanic and glacial debris into a deep, rapidly subsiding basin. The volcanic nature of these deposits implies that local volcanic activity was coeval with deposition. A minimum age of the Gaskiers Fm. is constrained by a diverse assemblage of Ediacaran-type fossils in the upper Conception Group dated at c. 565±3 Ma and in the lower St. John's Group, which overlies the Conception Group. A maximum age for the Gaskiers is provided by a U–Pb date of 606 +3.7/–2.9) Ma in the Harbour Main volcanic rocks underlying the Gaskiers Fm. A thin limestone bed has also been identified at two localities in Conception Bay directly overlying the diamictite yielding strongly negative δ13C values.},

At Omutirapo, in northern Namibia, a 2?km wide, 400?m deep palaeovalley is filled by glaciogenic strata of the Chuos Formation, which represents the Sturtian glacial record. Sedimentary logging of an exceptionally high-quality exposure permits detailed stratigraphic descriptions and interpretations, allowing two glacial cycles to be identified. At the base of the exposed succession, strong evidence supporting glaciation includes diamictites, ice-rafted dropstones and intensely sheared zones of interpreted subglacial origin. These facies collectively represent ice-proximal to ice-rafted deposits. Upsection, dropstone-free mudstones in the middle of the succession, and the absence of diamictites, imply sedimentation free from glacial influence. However, the reappearance of glacial deposits above indicates a phase of Sturtian glacial re-advance. Comparison with age-equivalent strata in South Australia, where evidence for sea-ice free sedimentation has been established previously, suggests that a Sturtian interglacial may have been extensive, implying global-scale waxing and waning of ice sheets during a Cryogenian glacial event.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Otavi Group is a Neoproterozoic carbonate-dominated succession up to 4?km thick, which blankets the southern promontory of the Congo craton in northern Namibia. This succession was deposited between 770 and 580?Ma in response to north?south crustal stretching and subsequent thermal subsidence. The main shallow-water platform has a well-defined southern limit, beyond which is a distally tapered foreslope wedge of deep-water carbonate facies. The Ghaub Formation represents the younger of two Cryogenian glaciations of the platform and was deposited during the period of thermal subsidence. A deep negative δ13C excursion, accompanied by increased size, abundance and variety of stromatolites, occurs in the last 10 to 80?m of shallow-water carbonate on the platform beneath the Ghaub glacial erosion surface. The same phenomena are observed before the older (Sturtian) glaciation in other areas, suggesting temporal proximity of the δ13C excursions to glaciation. Growth of ice sheets is manifested by emergence of the platform and development of a falling-stand wedge on the foreslope, composed of upward-coarsening carbonate turbidites and debrites. Rafts of very coarse-grained, well-sorted oolite have no source on the platform. The oolite probably originated at the strandline on the foreslope and was redeposited gravitationally downslope as sea-level fell. The Ghaub Formation is a laterally continuous wedge of carbonate diamictite, limited to the distal foreslope and ca 80?m in average thickness. Tongues of massive to weakly stratified diamictite, representing proglacial rain-out and subglacial tillite, are bounded by thinner, well-bedded units consisting of hypopycnal plume fallout, ice-rafted debris, turbidites and debrites, sorted sands and gravels, and westward-directed contourites. Debris is derived from the falling-stand wedge and the top 80?m of the inner platform. The wedge rests on a laterally continuous erosion surface, presumably cut by ice, and its sedimentary makeup and stratal organization are diagnostic of an ice grounding-line wedge. The subglacial erosion surface cuts a steep-walled trough on the distal foreslope, presumably once occupied by a transverse ice-stream. In the middle of the trough stands a doubly crested moraine composed of amalgamated unstratified diamictites. Terminal deglaciation is recorded by a fining-upward, 10?m thick drape of Fe-rich carbonate debrite and turbidite, loaded with far-travelled ice-rafted debris of all sizes. If deglaciation began with the collapse of ?sea-glacier? ice on the tropical ocean, the loss of this buttress could have triggered catastrophic ice-sheet drainage, concomitant with surface ocean ventilation. Complete deglaciation presumably was driven by ice-albedo, ice-elevation and greenhouse-gas feedbacks. The grounding-line wedge and bare upper foreslope and platform are overlain by a transgressive ?cap dolostone?, which features shallow-water sedimentary structures (sorted peloids, low-angle cross-bedding, tubestone stromatolite and giant wave ripples) from the distal foreslope to the inner platform. The structures and isotopic profiles show that it was deposited diachronously on the time scale of ice-sheet melting globally (kyr), implying very high sedimentation rates. Temperature-dependent isotope fractionation could account for the observed secular and lateral δ13C changes. This interpretation requires sea water pH lower than 7·3 (high pCO2) and warming of at least 45°C in the tropics, consistent with the change in planetary albedo accompanying global deglaciation. The thickness of the highstand part of the cap-carbonate sequence on the platform implies {\textgreater}3 to 5?Myr of tectonic subsidence during the glacial period to create permanent accommodation. The highstand sequence prograded inward from the raised rim of the platform, inherited from karstic and glacial erosion. Sea floor cements, formerly aragonitic, are localized over palaeobathymetric highs (ice-stream moraine, platform rim and inner platform highs). Subsequent aggradation of the platform and coeval foreslope shedding were accompanied by a 0·5?km thick stratigraphic interval in which platform strata are depleted in 13C by up to 2·5?, compared with coeval foreslope strata; this again suggests temperature-dependent fractionation at low pH. Above this interval, the δ13C gradient reverts to normal (platform strata more enriched in 13C than foreslope equivalents), consistent with CO2 drawdown due to silicate weathering.},

The Witvlei Group is preserved in two regional synclinoria in the Gobabis-Witvlei area of east-central Namibia and as isolated outcrops 90 km SW of Rehoboth, itself some 200 km south of that area. It consists of mixed, coarse- to fine-grained siliciclastic and carbonate strata deposited in deep- to shallow-marine, and locally non-marine, settings along the post-rift continental margin of the Kalahari Craton prior to the onset of foreland basin sedimentation recorded by the overlying terminal Neoproterozoic–Cambrian Nama Group. No direct age constrains exist for the Witvlei Group, but it post-dates c. 800 Ma rift-related rocks and pre-dates the c. 548 Ma base of the Nama Group, thereby placing it as Cryogenian to Ediacaran in age.
The Witvlei Group consists of three main units, from oldest to youngest, the Blaubeker, Court and Buschmannsklippe Formations. The Blaubeker Formation is highly variable in thickness and can be as much as 1000 m thick. It consists mostly of massive, polymict diamictite and, in the area of the type locality, contains conglomerate and pebbly sandstone beds. The diamictic strata combined with the presence of numerous faceted and striated clasts provide the evidence for glaciogenic influences on sedimentation. The highly variable thickness pattern likely reflects the infill of palaeo-valleys formed by the deep erosion and scouring of bedrock by ice, and the conglomerates and pebbly sandstones record glacial outwash processes. The Tahiti Formation is a locally developed, fine-grained sandstone above the Blaubeker Formation. It is poorly exposed and its exact stratigraphic relationship to the Blaubeker rocks and overlying Court Formation remains to be determined.
The Blaubeker rocks are overlain sharply by the basal unit of the Court Formation, the Gobabis Member. This Member is from 20 to 60 m thick and consists mostly of dark and light grey laminated dolostones that display a δ13Ccarbonate profile that rises from values of −4‰ in the lowermost beds to values of 5‰ in the topmost. The Gobabis Member is conformably overlain by the shales, marls and thin limestones of the Constance Member followed by quartzites of the uppermost unit of the Court Formation, the Simmenau Member.
The basal unit of the Buschmannsklippe Formation is the light to tan and pink grey dolostone of the Bildah Member. Its basal contact is sharp everywhere, and it is gradationally overlain by a coarsening (shoaling) upward succession from shales, thin limestones (some exhibiting formerly aragonitic fans) and fine sandstones of the La Fraque Member, to interbedded quartzites and stromatolitic and cherty dolostones of the Okambara Member. The δ13Ccarbonate profile for the Buschmannsklippe rocks shows that the basal beds of the Bildah Member begin at –4‰, followed by a decline to –6‰ in the lower La Fraque limestones and then a rise to –3‰ in the dolostones of the Okambara Member before being truncated by the base of the regionally unconformably overlying basal Weissberg Quartzite Member of the lower Nama Group. Although no glacial sediments have been recognized below the Bildah Member, its lithofacies character, stratigraphic position and C-isotopic profile are compatible with and strikingly similar to younger Cryogenian cap carbonates. Thus, the Witvlei Group arguably contains both the older and younger cap carbonates of Neoproterozoic time, but only the older Cryogenian glacial deposit.},

The Port Nolloth Group makes up the eastern, external part of the Pan-African Gariep Belt (Port Nolloth Zone) in southern Namibia and western South Africa. It contains two glaciogenic diamictite units, the older Kaigas Formation and the younger Numees Formation, with intercalated and overlying carbonate-dominated units. Available chemostratigraphic information include O, C and Sr isotope data. Micropalaeontological and geochronological data point to an early Cryogenian age (c. 750 Ma) of the Kaigas Formation and possibly a middle Ediacaran age (c. 580 Ma) for the Numees Formation. The former was deposited in an evolving, but eventually failed, continental rift on the western flank of the Kalahari Craton, probably at low latitude. The Numees Formation is a laterally continuous, up to 600-m-thick glaciomarine deposit for which a passive continental margin setting has been suggested. Alternatively, based on more recent data, the depositional setting might have been a back-arc basin. The eroded remnants of the corresponding arc are present in the Dom Feliciano Belt.},

Strontium isotope ratios in particular hold promise as chronostratigraphic tools if well-preserved samples can be identified, and if long-term trends through the Neoproterozoic show a regular progression to more radiogenic values. Based on analyses of high Sr limestone samples from cap carbonate lithofacies, we recognise four discrete glacial events in southwestern Gondwana, including two Sturtian, one Marinoan and one Gaskiers ice age. Notably, the Namibian Maieberg cap carbonate – considered by many to be a Marinoan archetype – sits stratigraphically below a profound positive carbon isotope excursion (called the Hüttenberg anomaly) and is correlated using Sr isotope ratios with an identical post-glacial cap in Brazil dated at ca. 740Ma by Pb-Pb carbonate techniques. If correct, the Pb-Pb age constraint places the Ghaub ice age and its equivalents into the Sturtian epoch.},

Its upper part, the Mozaan Group (ϳ5000 m-thick) includes diamictites with a highly varied suite of clasts, some of which are striated and faceted. Clasts in associated stratiﬁed siltstones are interpreted as ice-rafted debris. A glacial origin is also supported by geochemical investigation of diamictite matrix materials and associated mudstones. Plots of SiO2:Al2O3 and TiO2: Al2O3 suggest that these rocks underwent little chemical weathering, an interpretation conﬁrmed by calculation of a Chemical Index of Alteration with low values, typical of other glacial deposits. The analyzed rocks are rich in Fe (average Fe2O3(T) is ϳ24\% wt \%), like rocks of many other glaciomarine successions. The diamictites and associated mudstones of the Mozaan Group have low Th/Sc ratios, suggesting preferential incorporation of maﬁc materials into the diamictite matrix material. Previous studies suggest that this part of the Kaapvaal craton underwent early cratonization, involving tectonic and plutonic events that may have contributed to the drawdown of atmospheric CO2 and eventually provided a suitable substrate for development of continental glaciers.},

	abstract = {Glacial diamictites, with ages ranging from ∼2900 to 0.01Ma, record the changing composition of the upper continental crust through time (Gaschnig et al., 2014). Li concentrations and isotopic compositions, combined with Pb isotopic compositions, chemical index of alteration (CIA) values and relative Sr concentrations are used here to assess the degree of chemical weathering recorded in these deposits and the origin of this signature. The δ7Li values of most of the diamictites (ranging from −3.9 to +3.5) are lower than those of mantle-derived basalts (+3.7±2, 2σ), and the low δ7Li values are generally accompanied by high CIA and low Sr/Sr∗ values (or Sr depletion factor, Sr/Sr∗=Sr/(Ce∗Nd)0.5), reflecting a weathering signature that may have derived from pre-depositional, syn-depositional, and/or post-depositional weathering processes. Profiles through three glacial diamictites with relatively high CIA (a fresh road cut of the Neoproterozoic Nantuo Formation (CIA=62–69), and drill cores through the Paleoproterozoic Timeball Hill (CIA=66–75) and Duitschland Formations (CIA=84–91)) do not show evidence of significant post-depositional weathering. High Th/U, reflecting loss of uranium during oxidative weathering, is seen in all Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic diamictites and a few Paleoproterozoic deposits. Pb isotopic systematics suggest that this signature was largely inherited from preexisting crust, although a subset of samples (the Neoproterozoic Konnarock, Paleozoic Dwyka, and several of the Paleoproterozoic Duitschland samples) appears to have experienced post-depositional U loss. Modern glaciomarine sediments record little weathering (CIA=47, Sr/Sr∗=0.7, δ7Li=+1.8), consistent with the cold temperatures accompanying glacial periods, and suggesting that limited syn-depositional weathering has occurred. Thus, the chemical weathering signature observed in ancient glacial diamictites appears to be largely inherited from the upper continental crust (UCC) over which the glaciers traversed. The strength of this weathering signature, based on the CIA, is greatest in the Mesoarchean and some of the Paleoproterozoic diamictites and is weaker in the Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic glacial diamictites. Combining these data with data for Archean shales and other types of post-Paleoproterozoic sedimentary rocks (i.e., shales, mudstones, etc.), it appears that post-Paleoproterozoic upper continental crust experienced less intense chemical weathering, on average, than Archean and Paleoproterozoic upper continental crust.},

	abstract = {Large river sediments are mostly derived from tectonically active mountain belts, but then undergo a series of sedimentation, temporary storage and reworking episodes on their journey to the ocean. The long transfer time of these sediments through active floodplains might result in a significant chemical maturation via weathering reactions, which is of critical importance for biogeochemical cycles at the Earth surface. This study reports the chemical composition of river sediments from different locations throughout the courses of the main tributaries of the Amazon Basin. Sampling along river depth-profiles yields access to the whole grain size and chemical composition range of river sediment. Here, weathering intensities (i.e. losses of Na, K, Mg and Ca) associated with chemical weathering in floodplains are (1) examined as a function of grain size, and (2) integrated over the whole grain size range, for three selected long river reaches flowing through the foreland and the lowland of the Amazon Basin: the upper Marañon, the Beni and the lower Madeira rivers. A relatively small Na loss through plagioclase dissolution is observed in the Madeira reach, while an important Ca loss due to carbonate dissolution occurs in the two foreland reaches (Marañon and Beni). No significant loss of K and Mg is observed in any of the reaches, showing the low alterability of primary K and Mg-bearing minerals and suggesting retention of K and Mg in the particulate phase by secondary minerals. The combination of these findings with previously reported data on the downstream change of dissolved Na, K, Mg and Ca fluxes suggests that chemical weathering of “stable” alluvial deposits could also significantly contribute to theweathering flux generated in foreland and lowland areas. The comparison between the three Amazon reaches and the Gangetic plain tends to show that the features observed in the Amazon are valid on a global scale. Finally, we show that, although resulting in a relatively small change in the chemical composition of the river sediment, silicate weathering in the lower Madeira floodplain can lead to a CO2 drawdown equivalent to ca. 10\% of the total CO2 consumption flux of the whole Madeira basin.},

	abstract = {The subequatorial Angolan continental margin offers excellent conditions to test textbook theories on the composition of passive-margin sediments generated in different climatic and tectonic regimes. We use here comprehensive petrographic, heavy-mineral, geochemical and zircon-geochronology datasets on modern fluvial, beach, shelfal, and deep-marine sands and muds collected from hyperarid northern Namibia to hyperhumid Congo to investigate and assess: a) how faithfully sand mineralogy reflects the lithological and time structures of source rocks in a tectonically active rifted margin; b) in what climatic and geomorphological conditions the mark of chemical weathering becomes strong and next overwhelming; and, c) to what extent the effect of weathering can be isolated from quartz dilution by recycling of older siliciclastic strata and other physical controls including hydraulic sorting and mechanical wear. A new refined classification of feldspatho-quartzose and quartzose sands and sandstones is proposed. First-cycle quartzo-feldspathic to feldspar-rich feldspatho-quartzose sand eroded from mid-crustal granitoid gneisses of the Angola Block exposed in the dynamically uplifted Bié-Huila dome is deposited in arid southern Angola, whereas quartz-rich feldspatho-quartzose to quartzose sand characterizes the lower-relief, less deeply dissected, and more intensely weathered rifted margin of humid northern Angola. Pure quartzose, largely recycled sand is generated in the vast, low-lying hyperhumid continental interiors drained by the Congo River. The progressive relative increase of durable minerals toward the Equator results from three distinct processes acting in accord: active tectonic uplift in the arid south, and progressively stronger weathering coupled with more extensive recycling in the humid north. The quartz/feldspar ratio increases and the plagioclase/feldspar ratio decreases rapidly in first-cycle sand generated farther inland in the Catumbela catchment, reflecting stronger weathering in wet interior highlands. Discriminating weathering from recycling control is difficult in northern Angola. Although textural features including deep etch pits even on relatively resistant minerals such as quartz and microcline or rounded outline and abraded overgrowths provide valuable independent information, recycling remains as a most elusive problem in provenance analysis of terrigenous sediments.},

	abstract = {Complementary mineralogical and geochemical datasets on fluvial, beach and dune samples collected along the Atlantic margin of subequatorial southwestern Africa are used to investigate the relationships between provenance and climatic controls on sediment composition and to test the reliability of different geochemical and mineralogical weathering proxies as climatic indicators. The studied N/S-trending coastal region is characterized by strong latitudinal and inland climatic gradients, and thus represents an excellent natural laboratory in which to study the effects of climatic-induced weathering on sediment composition. Although the mineralogy and geochemistry of suspended-load muds closely reflects the different weathering intensities over both latitudinal and inland climatic gradients, the composition of mud and sand samples are strongly affected by sediment provenance. Consequently, weathering parameters such as the αAlE values (estimating the degree of depletion in element E relative to the UCC standard), display complex patterns of variation especially for sand samples. By assuming a typical order of bulk-sediment mobility Na{\textgreater}Ca{\textgreater}Sr{\textgreater}Mg{\textgreater}K{\textgreater}Ba≈Rb, anomalously high or low αAl values placing a specific element off the expected mobility order are considered as an indicator of source-rock control on sediment composition. The composition of detritus recycled from Meso-Cenozoic strata reflects the cumulative effect of successive sediment cycles, with recycling processes affecting to a different extent the diverse weathering proxies. In particular, αAlNa appears to be more strongly affected by recycling in muds than in sands. Among all mineralogical and chemical parameters, those that correlate best with rainfall in the drainage areas are αAlNa for sands, αAlMg for muds and smectite content (only in areas of low rainfall). In the geological and geomorphological setting of SW Africa these proxies turn out to be better climate estimators than the classical weathering indices CIA or WIP. This case study reminds us to carefully consider source-rock control and mixing with recycled detritus when drawing inferences on climatic conditions based on weathering indices.},

The selected representative compositions used in the computations belong to the following three regional petrological associations: (1) the average composition of Precambrian shields and platform (70\%), (2) granitoids of orogenic areas (20\%), and (3) tonalitic series of batholiths in continental margins (10\%). The calculated proportions are consistent with the tectonic systematics and the distribution of the main types of crustal rocks over a standard seismic profile of the crust to a depth of 20 km. In order to reveal the geochemistry of the upper crust, the calculations also involved data on the distribution of some trace elements: Rb, Sr, Ba, Zr, Nb, La, Th, U, Cr, and Ni. The calculated average composition of the upper crust corresponds to granodiorite and is similar to other known model estimates, in spite of the significant differences in the approaches used in these models. This similarity seems to be caused by general petrological regularities: a system of evolutionary trends common for the whole crust and the convergence of processes of crustal magmatism and metamorphism.},

This may be a secondary result of vertical chemical zoning of the crust as a result of metamorphism accompanied by anatectic melting. The erosion of a zoned crust would result in the enrichment of elements such as K, Na, Si, U, and Th in younger sedimentary basins. The crystalline crust subsequently evolved from the sediments of these basins would be enriched in these elements relative to older rocks exposed as a result of erosion. The secular chemical evolution of the shield may also reflect a progressive, though irregular, shift in the composition of new sial being added to the crust. Evidence for this progressive change is found in the increase in the abundance of potassium of successive dike swarms that were feeders of new sial to the upper part of the crust., non disponible},

	abstract = {We report abundances of sixty-three major, trace, and rare earth elements in the upper crust in five tectonic units (the interior and southern margin of the North China craton, the North and South Qinling orogenic belts, and the Yangtze craton) of central East China and the study area as a whole. The estimates are based on sampling of 11,451 individual rock samples over an area of 950,000 km2, from which 905 large composite samples were prepared and analyzed by thirteen methods. Some of the trace elements (i.e., Ag, As, Ge, Mo, Pd, Pt, Sb, Se, Sn, W) have never been subjected to systematic analysis in previous regional crustal composition studies. The middle, lower, and total crust compositions of the tectonic units are also estimated from studies of exposed crustal cross-sections and granulite xenoliths and by correlation of seismic data from eleven regional seismic refraction profiles with lithologies. The proposed granodioritic total crust composition has the following ratios of element pairs exhibiting similar compatibility, that are identical or close to the primitive mantle values: Zr/Hf = 37, Nb/Ta = 17.5, Ba/Th = 87, K/Pb = 0.12 × 104, Rb/Cs = 25, Ba/Rb = 8.94, Sn/Sm = 0.31, Se/Cd = 1.64, La/As = 10.3, Ce/Sb = 271, Pb/Bi = 57, Rb/Tl = 177, Er/Ag = 52, Cu/Au = 3.2×104, Sm/Mo = 7.5, Nd/W = 40, Cl/Li = 10.8, F/Nd = 21.9, and La/B = 1.8. The μ (238U/204Pb) value is calculated at ∼5. The upper crust composition is less evolved and higher in TiO2, total FeO, Co, Cr, Ni, Sc and V, and lower in Na2O, K2O and Nb, Ta, Rb, Th, U, and Zr, than previous estimates based on shield samplings. Because usually the uppermost layer of the crust, where mafic volcanics tend to concentrate, has been removed from Precambrian shields, and since our study involves Phanerozoic orogenic belts, the results are suggested to be better representative of the upper crust in a general sense. Trace elements associated with mineralization (e.g., B, Cl, Se, As, Bi, Pd, W, Th, Cs, Ta, Tl, Hg, Au, and Pb) show considerable inter-unit variations by a factor of 2–5 in the upper crust. In addition, the North Qinling paleoactive margin is characterized by anomalous enrichment in Th, U, and Pb in particular and has a marked lower μ value (3.3) compared to the two cratons and the South Qinling paleopassive margin (μ = 4.5–6.2). Each tectonic unit has a relatively homogenous middle crust composition which is broadly similar to the composition of the total crust. The lower crust in East China can be divided into two layers both seismically and chemically. The upper lower crust is characterized by Vp = 6.7 km s−1 and an intermediate composition and the lowermost crust by Vp = 7.1 km s−1 and a mafic composition. The bulk lower crust is still intermediate in composition with 58\% SiO2 due to the dominance of the upper lower crust. P-wave velocities of both the lower and total crusts in East China are slower by 0.2–0.4 km s−1 compared to various global estimates. Correspondingly, the total crust shows an more evolved composition and is characterized by a significant negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu∗ = 0.80), low Sr/Nd (10.4), and high La/Nb (3.0) ratios. The obtained SiO2 is 64\% on a volatile-free basis. The near arc magma La/Nb ratio implies that intraplate crustal growth contributes {\textless}10\% of the continental crust. The relative deficits in Eu, Sr, and transition metals (Cr, Ni, Co, V, and Ti) in the derived crustal compositions of East China, along with slower crustal velocity and thin crustal thickness for the Paleozoic to Mesozoic Qinling-Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, strongly suggest that lower crust delamination of eclogites, as represented by those from the Dabie-Sulu belt, had played an important role in modification of the East China crust during the Phanerozoic era.},

	abstract = {Weathering reactions mainly involve the transformation of feldspars, phyllosilicates, amphiboles, pyroxenes, and volcanic glass to the secondary mineral groups, kandites, illites, smectites, vermiculites, and/or chlorites. Although mineralogical changes are complex, bulk compositional changes to weathering profiles, resulting from chemical weathering, are simple and predictable from kinetic, thermodynamic, and mass balance considerations. Predicted bulk compositional changes are corroborated by studies of Recent weathering profiles developed on a variety of plutonic and volcanic rocks under different climatic regimes. Unlike the mineralogical compositions of profiles, the bulk compositional trends are not noticeably modified by climate; consequently, the simple, predictable bulk compositional trends observed in recent profiles provide a "norm" to which ancient weathering profiles can be compared. Early diagenetic reactions may occur prior to burial of the profile by reaction of groundwaters with secondary weathering products. These often result in abnormally high accumulations of Si, , Ca, and Mg to form clay minerals (smectites) and carbonates. The accumulations may be used as indicators of (paleo-)water tables. Late diagenetic reactions occur during and following burial through reaction of basin waters, trapped seawater, or brines with minerals of profiles. Metasomatism is common and includes production of illites, smectites, and chlorites at the expense of kaolinite and reconstitution of partially degraded feldspars to form potash feldspar and albite. Reaction with seawater (high Na/K and Mg/K) results in Na- and Mg-metasomatism, yielding albite and chlorite at the expense of partially degraded feldspars and clay minerals. In contrast, K-metasomatism of buried weathering profiles is favored around the periphery of subsiding continental sedimentary basins where dilute continental ground waters display low Na/K values. NaCl-rich brines and high temperatures in the deep central parts of basins favor the formation of albite at the expense of K-feldspar.},

	abstract = {Relative bulk leach rates of the major elements Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, Ti, and Si from studied basaltic weathering profiles are not greatly affected by primary mineralogy or by bulk composition of the parent basalt, probably because major silicate phases are weathered at grossly similar rates. By contrast, trace element leach rates may be effectively controlled by their mineralogical siting in parent basalts. Release rates of trace elements, including potentially toxic heavy metals, are confidently predicted only where bulk compositions, mineralogical and modal analyses of the parent basalt are available. Ti is the most conservative major element in the basaltic profiles studied. Fe and Al are leached from soil zones and from weathering profiles subjected to extreme chemical weathering. Both Fe and Al, however, are effectively conserved in recent, aerated profiles that have suffered moderate to extensive (but not extreme) weathering. Generally, Al is more extensively leached than Fe(III), an observation supported both by bulk compositional changes of profiles and by compositions of associated weathering solutions. Climatic conditions do not affect greatly the gross, relative release rates of major elements from weathered basalts. By implication mechanisms of chemical weathering are similar regardless of climate. Climate, however, affects dramatically the relative rates of chemical and physical weathering (that is, leaching and erosion). The diverse clay mineral suites observed in soils of various climates may result more from establishment of different steady state conditions in each climatic regime (chemical weathering versus erosion) than from different weathering-reaction mechanisms. During weathering of the Baynton Basalt, the order of susceptibility of primary phases is olivine {\textgreater} glass {\textgreater} plagioclase {\textgreater} clinopyroxene {\textgreater} Fe-Ti-oxide. Glass, plagioclase, and clinopyroxene are weathered at grossly similar rates. Field observations, local equilibrium, and kinetic considerations indicate that there is no fixed order of mineral susceptibility to weathering and no fixed leaching order of elements from basalts. Only after classification of a basalt according to bulk composition and model proportions can generalizations be made in these regards.},

We approach these linkages through synthesis of regolith data for granitic terrain compiled with respect to climate, geochemistry, and denudation rates for low sloping upland profiles. Focusing on Na as a proxy for plagioclase weathering, we quantified regolith Na depletion, Na mass loss, and the relative partitioning of denudation to physical and chemical contributions. The depth and magnitude of regolith Na depletion increased continuously with increasing water availability, except for locations with mean annual temperature {\textless}5°C that exhibited little Na depletion, and locations with physical erosion rates {\textless}20gm−2yr−1 that exhibited deep and complete regolith Na depletion. Surface Na depletion also tended to decrease with increasing physical erosion. Depth-integrated Na mass loss and regolith depth were both three orders of magnitude greater in the fully depleted, low erosion rate sites relative to other locations. These locations exhibited strong erosion-limitation of Na chemical weathering rates based on correlation of Na chemical weathering rate to total Na denudation. Sodium weathering rates in cool locations with positive annual water balance were strongly correlated to total Na denudation and precipitation, and exhibited an average apparent activation energy (Ea) of 69kJmol−1 Na. The remaining water-limited locations exhibited kinetic limitation of Na weathering rates with an Ea of 136kJmol−1 Na, roughly equivalent to the sum of laboratory measures of Ea and dissolution reaction enthalpy for albite. Water availability is suggested as the dominant factor limiting rate kinetics in the water-limited systems. Together, these data demonstrate marked transitions and nonlinearity in how climate and tectonics correlate to plagioclase chemical weathering and Na mass loss.},

	abstract = {In the Amazon Basin, substrate lithology and erosional regime (seen in terms of transport-limited and weathering-limited denudation) exert the most fundamental control on the chemistry of surface waters within a catchment. Secondary effects, such as the precipitation of salts within soils and in stream beds, biological uptake and release, and cyclic salt inputs, are more difficult to discern. Samples can be separated into four principal groupings based on relationships between total cation charge (TZ+) and geology. (1) Rivers with 0{\textless}TZ+{\textless}200 μeq/l drain the most intensely weathered materials (Upper Tertiary sediments, soils of the Negro Basin, and similarly weathered regions). These rivers show high levels of Fe, Al, H+, and coloration and are enriched in Si relative to other major species; they exhibit cation ratios similar to those of substrate rocks. (2) Rivers with 200{\textless}TZ+{\textless}450;μeq/l drain siliceous terrains. These rivers are also rich in silica relative to other species. Rivers draining weathering-limited siliceous terrains exhibit the highest TZ+ and their cation load is typically preferentially enriched in Na over K and Ca over Mg when compared to the rocks in their catchments. (3) Rivers with 450{\textless}TZ+{\textless}3000 μeq/l drain marine sediments or red beds with high cation concentrations (resulting from the presence of carbonates and minor evaporites in the Peruvian Andes and reduced shales and minor carbonates in the Bolivian Andes). These rivers exhibit relatively high levels of Ca, Mg, alkalinity, and SO4 (in rivers draining reduced shales and minor evaporites). (4) Rivers with TZ+{\textgreater}3000 μeq/l drain massive evaporites. These rivers are rich in Na and Cl. In the third and fourth categories, rivers tend to have 1:1 (equivalent) ratios of Na:Cl and (Ca+Mg):(alkalinity+SO4), caused primarily by the weathering of carbonates and evaporites.

	abstract = {Analyses of precipitation and surface water are used to estimate the fluxes of marine cyclic salts through that part of the Amazon River system draining past Obidos (80\% of the basin) at the time of peak discharge in June. Amazon precipitation chemistry can be devided into two principal components: marine and terrestrial. The marine component (determined from analyses of marine rain) consists of Na, K, Mg, Ca, and Cl in approximately sea-salt proportions, with S doubly enriched. The excess sulfur is probably derived from gas phase inputs. The terrestrial component makes an important contribution of K, Ca, S, and N, much of which can be related to biological emissions. The emission of reduced sulfur in the marine and terrestrial environment and nitrogen in the terrestrial environment is responsible for a natural ‘acid rain’ in the Amazon region with a pH from 4.7 to 5.7. This is about one tenth the acidity of polluted urban rain. The chloride content of lowland rivers, which drain regions lacking significant geologic sources of chloride, shows a systematic decrease in chloride with increasing distance from the ocean. This trend is used to define the cyclic salt background for Amazonian surface waters. Cyclic salts, in general, make only a minor contribution, relative to terrestrial inputs, to the chemistry of Amazon Basin rivers, even those draining intensely weathered terrains. An estimated 17.6\%-Cl, 6.9\%-Na, 1.3\%-Mg, 3.6\%-S, 0.4\%-K, and 0.1\%-Ca of the dissolved load at Obidos during peak discharge is cyclic.},

However, the effect of cooling during the Late Cenozoic era, including the onset of Pliocene–Pleistocene Northern Hemisphere glaciation (about two to three million years ago), on global erosion rates remains unclear1,2,3,4. The uncertainty arises mainly from a lack of consensus on the use of the sedimentary record as a proxy for erosion3,4 and the difficulty of isolating the respective contributions of tectonics and climate to erosion5,6,7. Here we compile 18,000 bedrock thermochronometric ages from around the world and use a formal inversion procedure8 to estimate temporal and spatial variations in erosion rates. This allows for the quantification of erosion for the source areas that ultimately produce the sediment record on a timescale of millions of years. We find that mountain erosion rates have increased since about six million years ago and most rapidly since two million years ago. The increase of erosion rates is observed at all latitudes, but is most pronounced in glaciated mountain ranges, indicating that glacial processes played an important part. Because mountains represent a considerable fraction of the global production of sediments9, our results imply an increase in sediment flux at a global scale that coincides closely with enhanced cooling during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs10,11.},

We examine the topographic implications of two leading classes of river erosion model, detachment-limited and transport-limited, in order to identify diagnostic and testable differences between them. Several formulations predict distinctly different longitudinal profile shapes, which are shown to be closely linked to terrain morphology. Of these, some can be rejected on the basis of unrealistic morphology and slope-area scaling. An expression is derived for total drainage basin relief and its apportionment between hillslope and fluvial components. Relief and valley density are found to vary with tectonic forcing in a manner that reflects erosion physics; these properties therefore constitute an additional set of testable predictions. Finally, transient responses to tectonic perturbations are shown to depend strongly on the degree of nonlinearity in the incision process. These findings indicate that given proper constraints, fluvial erosion theories can be tested on the basis of observed topography.},

	abstract = {Developing a quantitative understanding of the factors that control the rate of river incision into bedrock is critical to studies of landscape evolution and the linkages between climate, erosion, and tectonics. Current models of long-term river network incision differ significantly in their treatment of the role of sediment flux. We analyze the implications of various sediment-flux-dependent incision models for large-scale topography, in an attempt (1) to identify quantifiable and diagnostic differences between models that could be detected from topographic data or from the transient responses of perturbed systems and (2) to explain the apparent ubiquity of mixed bedrock-alluvial channels in active orogens. Although certain forms of the various models can be discarded as inconsistent with morphological data, we find that the relative intrinsic concavity indices of detachment- and transport-limited systems (defined herein) largely dictate whether the various models can be tied to distinctive steady state morphologies. Preliminary data suggest that no such diagnostic differences may exist, and other methods must be developed to test models. Accordingly, we develop and explore differences in the scaling behavior of topographic relief and the extent of detachment- versus transport-limited channels as a function of rock uplift rate that may allow discrimination among various models. Further, we explore potentially diagnostic differences in the rates and patterns of transient channel response to changes in rock uplift rate. In addition to general differences between detachment- and transport-limited systems our analysis identifies an interesting hysteresis in landscape evolution: “hybrid” channels at the threshold between detachment- and transport-limited conditions are expected to act as detachment-limited systems in response to an increase in rock uplift rate (or base level fall) and as transport-limited systems in response to a decrease in rock uplift rate, especially during postorogenic topographic decline. The analyses presented set the stage for field studies designed to test quantitatively the various river incision models that have been proposed.},

	abstract = {The role of ﬂuid residence time and catchment length scales in controlling the chemical composition of rivers is evaluated by comparing numerical simulations and scaling arguments to concentration–discharge data from small catchments. The analysis suggests that poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates are an important control on the composition of stream waters and therefore chemical equilibrium between the dissolving and precipitating phases determines the maximum concentration and the maximum silicate weathering ﬂux. The modeling results suggest that the residence time of ﬂuid relative to the residence time required to approach chemical equilibrium can be used to assess the controls on solute ﬂuxes in small catchments, and possibly larger rivers. Catchments that show little variability in concentration with discharge (or “chemostatic behavior”) likely have average ﬂuid residence times that exceed the time required to reach chemical equilibrium. Conversely, decreases in concentration with increasing discharge are explained by average residence times shorter than required to approach chemical equilibrium, resulting in dilution. Solute ﬂuxes are also strongly impacted by the distribution of ﬂuid residence times in a basin. The ﬂuid residence time model provides an alternative framework for assessing both the relationship between discharge and concentration observed for individual catchments, and controls on the solute ﬂuxes of rivers. If ﬂuid residence times are a dominant control on weathering ﬂuxes, the chemistry of different rivers could vary entirely as a function of the nature subsurface ﬂow paths and the composition of the system at equilibrium, which is complex to predict and strongly coupled to biological processes, temperature and the composition of the system. As a result of thermodynamic and hydrologic restrictions on the amount of weathering, global solute ﬂuxes may depend more strongly on the geometry, relief, runoff and permeability of basins then on temperature and rates of erosion.},

	abstract = {Concentrations of weathering products in streams often show relatively little variation compared to changes in discharge, both at event and annual scales. In this study, several hypothesized mechanisms for this “chemostatic behavior” were evaluated, and the potential for those mechanisms to influence relations between climate, weathering fluxes, and CO2 consumption via mineral weathering was assessed. Data from Loch Vale, an alpine catchment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, indicates that cation exchange and seasonal precipitation and dissolution of amorphous or poorly crystalline aluminosilicates are important processes that help regulate solute concentrations in the stream; however, those processes have no direct effect on CO2 consumption in catchments. Hydrograph separation analyses indicate that old water stored in the subsurface over the winter accounts for about one-quarter of annual streamflow, and almost one-half of annual fluxes of Na and SiO2 in the stream; thus, flushing of old water by new water (snowmelt) is an important component of chemostatic behavior. Hydrologic flushing of subsurface materials further induces chemostatic behavior by reducing mineral saturation indices and increasing reactive mineral surface area, which stimulate mineral weathering rates. CO2 consumption by carbonic acid mediated mineral weathering was quantified using mass-balance calculations; results indicated that silicate mineral weathering was responsible for approximately two-thirds of annual CO2 consumption, and carbonate weathering was responsible for the remaining one-third. CO2 consumption was strongly dependent on annual precipitation and temperature; these relations were captured in a simple statistical model that accounted for 71\% of the annual variation in CO2 consumption via mineral weathering in Loch Vale.},

	abstract = {Concentration–discharge relationships have been widely used as clues to the hydrochemical processes that control runoff chemistry. Here we examine concentration–discharge relationships for solutes produced primarily by mineral weathering in 59 geochemically diverse US catchments. We show that these catchments exhibit nearly chemostatic behaviour; their stream concentrations of weathering products such as Ca, Mg, Na, and Si typically vary by factors of only 3 to 20 while discharge varies by several orders of magnitude. Similar patterns are observed at the inter-annual time scale. This behaviour implies that solute concentrations in stream water are not determined by simple dilution of a fixed solute flux by a variable flux of water, and that rates of solute production and/or mobilization must be nearly proportional to water fluxes, both on storm and inter-annual timescales. We compared these catchments' concentration–discharge relationships to the predictions of several simple hydrological and geochemical models. Most of these models can be forced to approximately fit the observed concentration–discharge relationships, but often only by assuming unrealistic or internally inconsistent parameter values. We propose a new model that also fits the data and may be more robust. We suggest possible tests of the new model for future studies. The relative stability of concentration under widely varying discharge may help make aquatic environments habitable. It also implies that fluxes of weathering solutes in streams, and thus fluxes of alkalinity to the oceans, are determined primarily by water fluxes. Thus, hydrology may be a major driver of the ocean-alkalinity feedback regulating climate change. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The isotope ratio of the meteoric cosmogenic nuclide 10Be to the mineral-derived stable isotope 9Be discloses both the Earth surface denudation rate and its weathering intensity. We develop a set of steady state mass balance equations that describes this system from a soil column over the hillslope scale to an entire river basin. The prerequisites making this new approach possible are: (1) the 9Be concentration of parent rock (typically 2.5 7 0.5 ppm in granitic and clastic sedimentary lithologies) is known; (2) both Be isotopes equilibrate between the ﬂuids decomposing rock and reactive solids formed during weathering; and (3) a critical spatial scale is exceeded at which the ﬂuxes of both isotopes into and out of the weathering zone are at steady state over the time scale of weathering (typically \$ 10 kyr). For these cases the isotope ratios can be determined in bulk sediment or soil, on leachates from the reactive (adsorbed and pedogenic mineral-bound) phase in sediment or soil, and even on the dissolved phase in river water. The 10Be/9Be ratio offers substantial advantages over the single-isotope system of meteoric 10Be. The latter system allows to directly determine erosion rates only in the case that 10Be is fully retentive in the weathering zone and that riverine sorting has not introduced grain size-dependent 10Be concentration gradients in sediments. We show the feasibility of the 10Be/9Be tracer approach at the river scale for sediment and water samples in the Amazon basin, where independent estimates of denudation rates from in situ-produced 10Be exist. We furthermore calculate meaningful denudation rates from a set of published 10Be/9Be ratios measured in the dissolved load of globally distributed rivers. We conclude that this isotope ratio can be used to reconstruct global paleo-denudation from sedimentary records.},

This robust relationship can explain approximately half of the variance in denudation from quartz-bearing topography drained by rivers using only mean slopes as the predictive tool and matches a similar ﬁt for large river basins. At slopes {\textgreater}200 m/ km, topography controls denudation rates. Controls on denudation in landscapes where average slopes are {\textless}{\textasciitilde}200 m/km are unclear, but sediment production rates in these areas average {\textasciitilde}45 mm/k.y., 75\% of the denudation rates being {\textgreater}10 mm/k.y. We use global topographic data to show that the vast majority of the Earth’s surface consists of these gently sloping surfaces with modest, but positive, gross denudation rates, and that these areas contribute the most sediment to the oceans. Because of the links between silicate weathering rates and denudation rates, the predominance of low sloping areas on the Earth’s surface compared to areas of steep mountainous topography implies that mountain uplift contributes little to drawdown of CO2 at cosmogenic nuclide time scales of 103–106 yr. The poorly understood environmental controls that set the pace of denudation for the largest portion of Earth’s surface hold the key to understanding the feedbacks between erosion and climate.},

Our 42 study sites encompass widely varying climatic and erosional regimes, with mean annual temperatures ranging from 2 to 25 jC, average precipitation ranging from 22 to 420 cmÁyearÀ 1, and denudation rates ranging from 23 to 755 tÁkmÀ 2ÁyearÀ 1. Long-term chemical weathering rates range from 0 to 173 tÁkmÀ 2 yearÀ 1, in several cases exceeding the highest granitic weathering rates on record from previous work. Chemical weathering rates are highest at the sites with rapid denudation rates, consistent with strong coupling between rates of chemical weathering and mineral supply from breakdown of rock. A simple empirical relationship based on temperature, precipitation and long-term denudation rates explains 89 – 95\% of the variation in long-term weathering rates across our network of sites. Our analysis shows that, for a given precipitation and temperature, chemical weathering rates increase proportionally with freshmaterial supply rates. We refer to this as ‘‘supply-limited’’ weathering, in which fresh material is chemically depleted to roughly the same degree, regardless of its rate of supply from breakdown of rock. The temperature sensitivity of chemical weathering rates is two to four times smaller than what one would expect from laboratory measurements of activation energies for feldspar weathering and previous inter-comparisons of catchment mass-balance data from the field. Our results suggest that climate change feedbacks between temperature and silicate weathering rates may be weaker than previously thought, at least in actively eroding, unglaciated terrain similar to our study sites. To the extent that chemical weathering rates are supply-limited in mountainous landscapes, factors that regulate rates of mineral supply from erosion, such as tectonic uplift, may lead to significant fluctuations in global climate over the long term.},

	abstract = {Quantifying long-term rates of chemical weathering and physical erosion is important for understanding the long-term evolution of soils, landscapes, and Earth's climate. Here we describe how long-term chemical weathering rates can be measured for actively eroding landscapes using cosmogenic nuclides together with a geochemical mass balance of weathered soil and parent rock. We tested this approach in the Rio Icacos watershed, Puerto Rico, where independent studies have estimated weathering rates over both short and long timescales. Results from the cosmogenic/mass balance method are consistent with three independent sets of weathering rate estimates, thus confirming that this approach yields realistic measurements of long-term weathering rates. This approach can separately quantify weathering rates from saprolite and from overlying soil as components of the total. At Rio Icacos, nearly 50\% of Si weathering occurs as rock is converted to saprolite; in contrast, nearly 100\% of Al weathering occurs in the soil. Physical erosion rates are measured as part of our mass balance approach, making it particularly useful for studying interrelationships between chemical weathering and physical erosion. Our data show that chemical weathering rates are tightly coupled with physical erosion rates, such that the relationship between climate and chemical weathering rates may be obscured by site-to-site differences in the rate that minerals are supplied to soil by physical erosion of rock. One can normalize for variations in physical erosion rates using the “chemical depletion fraction,” which measures the fraction of total denudation that is accounted for by chemical weathering. This measure of chemical weathering intensity increases with increasing average temperature and precipitation in data from climatically diverse granitic sites, including tropical Rio Icacos and six temperate sites in the Sierra Nevada, California. Hence, across a wide range of climate regimes, analysis of chemical depletion fractions appears to effectively account for site-to-site differences in physical erosion rates, which would otherwise obscure climatic effects on chemical weathering rates. Our results show that by quantifying rates of physical erosion and chemical weathering together, our mass balance approach can be used to determine the relative importance of climatic and nonclimatic factors in regulating long-term chemical weathering rates.},

	abstract = {Rates of accommodation and sediment supply are the principal controls on stacking patterns in siliciclastic basin fills. Stratigraphic inversion is aimed at reconstruction of these controls from the detrital record. Efforts to ‘explain’ siliciclastic basin fills have been focused on analysis and numerical modelling of sequence geometry in response to changes in accommodation, whereas comparatively few studies have attempted to address the role of sediment supply. The compositional and textural properties of siliciclastic basin fills are linked with the evolution of drainage basins through the principle of climatic–physiographic control of sediment production and supply. Application of this principle leads to a method of compositional analysis for distinguishing sequences controlled by high-frequency changes in the rate of accommodation from sequences controlled by high-frequency variations in the rate of sediment supply (order of 10 kyr). This method does not require detailed time control. Changes in rate and type of sediment supplied to depositional systems in response to environmental perturbations in drainage basins are explored in greater detail by means of a numerical model of sediment production under various scenarios of climatic and tectonic forcing. Simulation experiments suggest that drainage basins respond differently to high-frequency tectonic and climatic perturbations. Synthetic time series of cyclically forced sediment production display different types of asymmetric variations in grain size, accumulation rate and residence time of sediments in response to tectonic and climatic forcing. The results also highlight the role of vegetation as the principal modulator of climate forcing, and show that the nonlinear response to climate change may frustrate any attempts at providing broad generalizations of the system's responses. The modelling results confirm the usefulness of a combined analysis of sediment composition and sequence geometry, and the mathematically rich behaviour of the system suggests that further development of this approach is likely to increase our ability to reconstruct forcing mechanisms and initial boundary conditions from the detrital record.},

	abstract = {We present an extensive river sediment dataset covering the Ganga basin from the Himalayan front downstream to the Ganga mainstream in Bangladesh. These sediments were mainly collected over several monsoon seasons and include depth profiles of suspended particles in the river water column. Mineral sorting is the first order control on the chemical composition of river sediments. Taking into account this variability we show that sediments become significantly depleted in mobile elements during their transit through the floodplain. By comparing sediments sampled at the Himalayan front with sediments from the Ganga mainstream in Bangladesh it is possible to budget weathering in the floodplain. Assuming a steady state weathering regime in the floodplain, the weathering of Himalayan sediments in the Gangetic floodplain releases ca. (189±92)×109 and (69±22)×109mol/yr of carbonate bound Ca and Mg to the dissolved load, respectively. Silicate weathering releases (53±18)×109 and (42±13)×109mol/yr of Na and K while the release of silicate Mg and Ca is substantially lower, between ca. 0 and 20×109mol/yr. Additionally, we show that sediment hydration, [H2O+], is a sensitive tracer of silicate weathering that can be used in continental detrital environments, such as the Ganga basin. Both [H2O+] content and the D/H isotopic composition of sediments increases during floodplain transfer in response to mineral hydrolysis and neoformations associated to weathering reactions. By comparing the chemical composition of river sediments across the floodplain with the composition of the eroded Himalayan source rocks, we suggest that the floodplain is the dominant location of silicate weathering for Na, K and [H2O+]. Overall this work emphasizes the role of the Gangetic floodplain in weathering Himalayan sediments. It also demonstrates how detrital sediments can be used as weathering tracers if mineralogical and chemical sorting effects are properly taken into account.},

Technically, an inverse method is used to solve a model containing of a series of mass budget equations relating river concentrations to chemical weathering products and atmospheric inputs. New estimates of global silicate weathering fluxes and associated CO2 consumption fluxes are given. The role of basalt weathering on oceanic islands and volcanic arcs is emphasized. For each large river, an attempt is made to calculate chemical weathering rates of silicates per unit area. Only relative chemical weathering rates can be calculated. The relationships between the chemical weathering rates of silicates and the possible controlling parameters are explored. A combined effect of runoff-temperature and physical denudation seems to explain the variability of modern silicate chemical weathering rates. The results of this study highlight the coupling between the physical and the chemical processes of silicate weathering.

An analysis of weathering rates for granitic material shows that weathering rates depend most strongly on fluid residence times and fluid flow rates, and depend very weakly on material age. Over moderate fluid residence times from 5days to 10yr, characteristic of soils and some aquifers, transport-controlled weathering explains the orders of magnitude variation in weathering rates to a better extent than material age. For fluid residence times greater than 10yr, characteristic of some aquifers, saprolites, and most marine sediments, a purely thermodynamic-control on chemical weathering rates sustains chemical weathering—this control may be due to clay precipitation, which can drive weathering of primary minerals, or microbial processes which alter the fluid chemistry via the oxidation of organic matter. In addition, this analysis suggests that the apparent time dependence of chemical weathering rates commonly used to model the evolution of Earth's landforms may be attributable to transport-controlled weathering and the evolution of hydrologic properties over time. If hydrologic processes are the primary control on chemical weathering rates, the nature of the temperature dependence of chemical weathering rates is also altered.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that thermodynamic limitations on chemical weathering rates exert a first-order control on riverine solute fluxes and by extension, global chemical weathering rates. As such, these limitations may play a prominent role in the regulation of carbon dioxide levels (pCO2) over geologic timescales by constraining the maximum global weathering flux. In this study, we develop a theoretical scaling relationship between equilibrium solute concentrations and pCO2 based on equilibrium constants and reaction stoichiometry relating primary mineral dissolution and secondary mineral precipitation. We test this theoretical scaling relationship against reactive transport simulations of chemical weathering profiles under open- and closed-system conditions, representing partially and fully water-saturated regolith, respectively. Under open-system conditions, equilibrium bicarbonate concentrations vary as a power-law function of pCO2(y=kxn) where n is dependent on reaction stoichiometry and k is dependent on both reaction stoichiometry and the equilibrium constant. Under closed-system conditions, bicarbonate concentrations vary linearly with pCO2 at low values and approach open-system scaling at high pCO2. To describe the potential role of thermodynamic limitations in the global silicate weathering feedback, we develop a new mathematical framework to assess weathering feedback strength in terms of both (1) steady-state atmospheric pCO2 concentrations, and (2) susceptibility to secular changes in degassing rates and transient carbon cycle perturbations, which we term 1st and 2nd order feedback strength, respectively. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the effects of vascular land plant evolution on feedback strength, the potential role of vegetation in controlling modern solute fluxes, and the application of these frameworks to a more complete functional description of the silicate weathering feedback. Most notably, the dependence of equilibrium solute concentrations on pCO2 may represent a direct weathering feedback largely independent of climate and modulated by belowground organic carbon respiration.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the major and trace element composition of suspended sediments transported by the world’s largest rivers. Its main purpose is to answer the following question: is the degree of weathering of modern river-borne particles consistent with the estimated river dissolved loads derived from silicate weathering? In agreement with the well known mobility of elements during weathering of continental rocks, we confirm that river sediments are systematically depleted in Na, K, Ba with respect to the Upper Continental Crust. For each of these mobile elements, a systematics of weathering indexes of river-borne solids is attempted. A global consistency is found between all these indexes. Important variations in weathering intensities exist. A clear dependence of weathering intensities with climate is observed for the rivers draining mostly lowlands. However, no global correlation exists between weathering intensities and climatic or relief parameters because the trend observed for lowlands is obscured by rivers draining orogenic zones. An inverse correlation between weathering intensities and suspended sediment concentrations is observed showing that the regions having the highest rates of physical denudation produce the least weathered sediments. Finally, chemical and physical weathering are compared through the use of a simple steady state model. We show that the weathering intensities of large river suspended sediments can only be reconciled with the (silicate-derived) dissolved load of rivers, by admitting that most of the continental rocks submitted to weathering in large river basins have already suffered previous weathering cycles. A simple graphical method is proposed for calculating the proportion of sedimentary recycling in large river basins. Finally, even if orogenic zones produce weakly weathered sediments, we emphasize the fact that silicate chemical weathering rates (and hence CO2 consumption rates by silicate weathering) are greatly enhanced in mountains simply because the sediment yields in orogenic drainage basins are higher. Hence, the parameters that control chemical weathering rates would be those that control physical denudation rates.},

	abstract = {This study attempts to characterise the chemical weathering of basalts and to quantify the flux of carbon transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean during this major process at the surface of the Earth. To this aim, we have compiled different published chemical compositions of small rivers draining basalts. Basaltic river waters are characterised by relatively high Na-normalized molar ratios (Ca/Na: 0.2–3.9; HCO3/Na: 1–10; Mg/Na: 0.15–6) in comparison with those usually observed for river draining silicates. The data also show the climatic influence on basalt weathering and associated CO2 consumption. Runoff and temperature are the main parameters controlling the chemical weathering rate and derived CO2 consumption during basaltic weathering. From these relationships and digital maps, we are able to define the contribution of basalts to the global silicate flux. Taking account of this result, we estimate that the CO2 flux consumed by chemical weathering of basalts is about 4.08×1012 mol/year. The fluxes from the islands of Indonesia and regions of central America represent around 40\% of this flux. The global flux of CO2 consumed by chemical weathering of basalts represents between 30\% and 35\% of the flux derived from continental silicate determined by Gaillardet et al. [Chem. Geol. 159 (1999) 3]. Finally, it appears that volcanic activity not only acts as a major atmospheric CO2 source, but also creates strong CO2 sinks that cannot be neglected to better understand the geochemical and climatic evolution of the Earth.},

	abstract = {A conceptual isotopic/geochemical model is presented to explain the variation of major, trace and rare earth element (REE) geochemistry and Sr isotope systematics in suspended particulate matter (SPM) as a function of particle/colloid size. This conceptual model is an extension of a previous investigation of the origin of SPM in the Murray-Darling River system (MDRS) that utilised Sr isotope systematics to examine aspects of SPM (particle/colloid) origin, structure and mineralogy. The geochemical processes that give rise to the often coherent trends in major, trace and REE geochemistry and Sr isotopic signature as a function of particulate ({\textless}1 μm) and colloidal ({\textgreater}1 μm) size in the MDRS have been identified using an enhanced SPM size fractionation technique as a basis to not only obtain a broad range of particle/colloid size ranges, but also to provide sufficient material for subsequent geochemical and isotopic analysis. The conceptual isotopic/geochemical model proposed here contains three major components: (i) the differential weathering of micas and alkali (K-) feldspars to form the majority of the particulate ({\textless}1 μm) fractions (high 87Sr/86Sr ratio), which have a geochemical and Sr isotopic signature that closely resembles precursor mineralogies, (ii) the differential weathering of Na, Ca-feldspars (plagioclase) which decompose to form clay minerals in the colloidal ({\textgreater}1 μm) fractions (low 87Sr/86Sr ratio), with a range of geochemical signatures related to the relative proportions of inorganic and organic constituents, and (iii) the presence of natural organic matter as coatings on the particulate ({\textless}1 μm) and colloidal ({\textgreater}1 μm) matter and possibly as organo-colloids which exert an increasing influence in particular on bulk colloid geochemistry with decreasing colloid size. This conceptual isotopic/geochemical model also accounts for the distinct variation in major, trace and REE geochemistry and Sr isotopic systematics between the particulate ({\textless}1 μm) and colloidal ({\textgreater}1 μm) fractions, the variation being primarily a function of the distinctly different precursor mineralogies of the SPM fractions and geochemical fractionation during the weathering and transport. Additionally, this model explains a systematic fractionation of REE apparent within colloidal ({\textgreater}1 μm) fractions. Statisitcal (hierachical cluster) analysis of two particulate and three colloidal fractions from 23 samples from the MDRS is used as a basis to investigate geochemical and mineralogical associations within the particulate and colloidal size fractions and to provide additional supporting evidence for the conceptual isotopic/geochemical model.},

	abstract = {Neodymium and strontium isotopes and a suite of trace elements have been used to distinguish between the various sources of particulate loads and soils in a major catchment of the Murray-Darling drainage system, the largest river in Australia. One of the goals was to estimate additions of Sr and rare earth elements of anthropogenic (fertilizer) origin to the natural catchment sources to the soils and streams. Among possible sediment sources, Tertiary basalts and Paleozoic metagraywackes have the lowest 87Sr/86Sr and highest ϵNd, whereas Paleozoic metapelitic rocks have negative ϵNd and the highest 87Sr/86Sr. Phosphate fertilizers have strongly negative ϵNd and 87Sr/86Sr similar to Tertiary seawater. Soils formed on basalt and metagraywacke have compositions that are shifted toward higher 87Sr/86Sr and lower ϵNd than their parent rocks. REE patterns and elemental ratios such as Nd/P are also distinctive between fertilizer and natural catchment sources. Reservoir sediment from the upper catchment have isotopic and trace element compositions that confirm that the dominant source of stream particulates is from basalt soils in the steep upland part of the catchment. Mixing calculations based on isotopic and elemental compositions for reservoir sediment in the upper catchment are consistent with less than 0.2\% bulk addition by mass of fertilizer to the natural sediment source. The isotopic compositions of soils in less easily eroded portions of the upper catchment reflect the addition of a component to the soil which is interpreted to be wind-blown dust, derived either from Paleozoic granitoids that dominate the lower regions of the catchment or from more distal westerly sources. Sediment from the lower catchment requires that the dominant source below the reservoir is derived from Paleozoic granitoid and metapelitic rocks of the New England fold belt. The lower catchment sediments show no definitive evidence of either basalt or fertilizer input. Natural sources dominate the particulate loads in these streams.},

	abstract = {Grain-size distribution, major elements, nutrients and trace metals were determined in bed sediments and suspension collected at 10 representative sites along the river Po under normal and high flow conditions. Grain-size distribution and major element composition of suspension highlighted the presence of two distinct particle populations in the upper–middle Po (coarser particles, lower carbonate content) and in the lower Po (finer particles, higher carbonate content). This change partly reflects the geological differences between the two parts of the basin, and also the presence of a hydroelectric power plant at Isola Serafini (Piacenza). With respect to environmental quality issues, bed sediments and suspension provide similar results. A moderate nutrient pollution is found in all but the uppermost parts of the river basin, while the most significant inputs of trace metals appear to originate from the urban areas of Turin and Milan. Calculation of sediment enrichment factors identifies Cd, Cu, Hg and Zn as the most impacted elements by human activities. On the other hand, the high levels of Ni and Cr throughout the river seem to derive mainly from the presence of basic rocks in the upper and middle parts of the basin. Both nutrient and trace metal particulate concentrations substantially decrease under high flow conditions possibly due to “flushing” of contaminated bed sediments and resuspension of coarser material. Under normal flow conditions, water hydrochemistry and concentrations of some elements (As, Ca, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, and Pb) in the dissolved phase ({\textless}0.45μm) were also determined. Calculation of trace metals partition coefficients shows that the relative importance of the particulate and water phases varies in response to water hydrochemistry and suspended solid content, but that most elements achieve a conditional equilibrium in the lower stretches of the river Po. These results are the first of this kind reported for the whole river course and highlight the factors and mechanisms controlling the origin, mobility and fate of nutrients and trace metals in the river Po.},

	abstract = {Magnesium concentrations in deep-sea sediment pore-fluids typically decrease down core due to net precipitation of dolomite or clay minerals in the sediments or underlying crust. To better characterize and differentiate these processes, we have measured magnesium isotopes in pore-fluids and sediment samples from Ocean Drilling Program sites (1082, 1086, 1012, 984, 1219, and 925) that span a range of oceanographic settings. At all sites, magnesium concentrations decrease with depth. At sites where diagenetic reactions are dominated by the respiration of organic carbon, pore-fluid δ26Mg values increase with depth by as much as 2‰. Because carbonates preferentially incorporate 24Mg (low δ26Mg), the increase in pore-fluid δ26Mg values at these sites is consistent with the removal of magnesium in Mg-carbonate (dolomite). In contrast, at sites where the respiration of organic carbon is not important and/or weatherable minerals are abundant, pore-fluid δ26Mg values decrease with depth by up to 2‰. The decline in pore-fluid δ26Mg at these sites is consistent with a magnesium sink that is isotopically enriched relative to the pore-fluid. The identity of this enriched magnesium sink is likely clay minerals. Using a simple 1D diffusion–advection–reaction model of pore-fluid magnesium, we estimate rates of net magnesium uptake/removal and associated net magnesium isotope fractionation factors for sources and sinks at all sites. Independent estimates of magnesium isotope fractionation during dolomite precipitation from measured δ26Mg values of dolomite samples from sites 1082 and 1012 are very similar to modeled net fractionation factors at these sites, suggesting that local exchange of magnesium between sediment and pore-fluid at these sites can be neglected. Our results indicate that the magnesium incorporated in dolomite is 2.0–2.7‰ depleted in δ26Mg relative to the precipitating fluid. Assuming local exchange of magnesium is minor at the rest of the studied sites, our results suggest that magnesium incorporated into clay minerals is enriched in δ26Mg by 0‰ to +1.25‰ relative to the precipitating fluid. This work demonstrates the utility of magnesium isotopes as a tracer for magnesium sources/sinks in low-temperature aqueous systems.},

However, creating a new model typically demands a very large investment of time, and modifying an existing model to address a new problem typically means the new work is constrained to its detriment by model adaptations for a different problem. Landlab is an open-source software framework explicitly designed to accelerate the development of new process models by providing (1) a set of tools and existing grid structures – including both regular and irregular grids – to make it faster and easier to develop new process components, or numerical implementations of physical processes; (2) a suite of stable, modular, and interoperable process components that can be combined to create an integrated model; and (3) a set of tools for data input, output, manipulation, and visualization. A set of example models built with these components is also provided. Landlab's structure makes it ideal not only for fully developed modelling applications but also for model prototyping and classroom use. Because of its modular nature, it can also act as a platform for model intercomparison and epistemic uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Landlab exposes a standardized model interoperability interface, and is able to couple to third-party models and software. Landlab also offers tools to allow the creation of cellular automata, and allows native coupling of such models to more traditional continuous differential equation-based modules. We illustrate the principles of component coupling in Landlab using a model of landform evolution, a cellular ecohydrologic model, and a flood-wave routing model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This strategy assumes that the shape of a river profile is controlled by the history of uplift rate and moderated by the erosional process. We assume that upstream drainage area is invariant. The algorithm was tested on a set of ∼100 river profiles which were extracted from a digital elevation model of Madagascar. This set of profiles was simultaneously inverted to obtain uplift rate as a smooth function of space and time. The fit between observed and calculated profiles is excellent and suggests that Madagascar was uplifted by 1–2 km at rates of 0.2–0.4 mm/yr during the last ∼15 Myrs. The location of Madagascar suggests that its topographic elevation is maintained by convective circulation of the sub-lithospheric mantle. Residual depth anomalies of oceanic fragments encompassing the island show that the island straddles a dynamic topographic gradient which generates asymmetric Neogene uplift. Volcanism, warped peneplains and uplifted marine terraces corroborate the existence of youthful uplift. We suggest that sets of longitudinal river profiles contain useful information about the history of regional uplift which can be extracted by inverse modeling and calibrated by independent geologic observations.},

In their simplest form such models fail to consider potentially useful auxiliary information about the region and the accuracy of the maps may suffer as a result. In contrast, this study uses quantile regression forests (an elaboration of random forest) to investigate the potential of high resolution auxiliary information alone to support the generation of accurate and interpretable geochemical maps. This paper presents a summary of the performance of quantile regression forests in predicting element concentrations, loss on ignition and pH in the soils of south west England using high resolution remote sensing and geophysical survey data. Through stratified 10-fold cross validation we find the accuracy of quantile regression forests in predicting soil geochemistry in south west England to be a general improvement over that offered by ordinary kriging. Concentrations of immobile elements whose distributions are most tightly controlled by bedrock lithology are predicted with the greatest accuracy (e.g. Al with a cross-validated R2 of 0.79), while concentrations of more mobile elements prove harder to predict. In addition to providing a high level of prediction accuracy, models built on high resolution auxiliary variables allow for informative, process based, interpretations to be made. In conclusion, this study has highlighted the ability to map and understand the surface environment with greater accuracy and detail than previously possible by combining information from multiple datasets. As the quality and coverage of remote sensing and geophysical surveys continue to improve, machine learning methods will provide a means to interpret the otherwise-uninterpretable.},

The Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Environment is a long-established, high-resolution regional geochemical mapping project run by the British Geological Survey. A project initially stimulated by mineral exploration and to assist geological mapping has successfully evolved into a survey that has many environmental applications. Much of the current demand for surface geochemical data is driven by legislation. The geochemical mapping, originally based on the collection of drainage samples, has expanded to include soils and a further suite of determinands in stream waters. The methodology of the project and application of the baseline data are described and issues common to worldwide geochemical mapping programmes are discussed.},

	abstract = {Tectonic uplift is one of the key factors controlling the supply of material to weathering environments. At present however, there is debate about whether tectonics or climate plays a larger role in controlling chemical weathering rates on a global scale over geologic time. We measured riverine weathering fluxes from twelve catchments along the Skykomish River in the Washington Cascades, where long-term exhumation rates have been constrained by (U-Th)/He thermochronometry, to examine the effect of tectonic uplift on chemical weathering rates. We show that in the western Washington Cascades, dissolved Si fluxes increase from approximately 1900 to 3000 mol ha−1 yr−1 from west to east across the range and are correlated with rock exhumation rates. We use dissolved Si flux data from these catchments, depth to bedrock measurements, and long-term exhumation rates to test a steady-state weathering model that describes the relative importance of reaction kinetics and rock supply on weathering rates. Characterization of study basins with respect to two key variables in this model, weathering zone depth and exhumation rate, allows us to examine the relative effects of climate and tectonics on chemical weathering by analyzing the ratio of the timescale of reaction kinetics and the residence time in the weathering zone. Evaluation of this model shows that chemical weathering rates in the Cascades are controlled by the rate of rock erosion and factors that influence the depth of the active weathering zone. However, the model predicts that in tectonically inactive areas, the supply of material limits the overall rate of chemical weathering while in active tectonic or erosional environments, the rate of supply exceeds the ability of a system to weather that material resulting in a landscape in which weathering rates are expected to respond strongly to changes in climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Tectonic drivers of degassing and weathering processes are key long-term controls on atmospheric CO2. However, there is considerable debate over the changing relative importance of different carbon sources and sinks. Existing geochemical models have tended to rely on indirect methods to derive tectonic drivers, such as inversion of the seawater 87Sr/86Sr curve to estimate uplift or continental basalt area. Here we use improving geologic data to update the representation of tectonic drivers in the COPSE biogeochemical model. The resulting model distinguishes CO2 sinks from terrestrial granite weathering, total basalt weathering, and seafloor alteration. It also distinguishes CO2 sources from subduction zone metamorphism and from igneous intrusions. We reconstruct terrestrial basaltic area from data on the extent of large igneous provinces and use their volume to estimate their contribution to degassing. We adopt a recently published reconstruction of subduction-related degassing, and relate seafloor weathering to ocean crust creation rate. Revised degassing alone tends to produce unrealistically high CO2, but this is counteracted by the inclusion of seafloor alteration and global basalt weathering, producing a good overall fit to Mesozoic-Cenozoic proxy CO2 estimates and a good fit to 87Sr/86Sr data. The model predicts that seafloor alteration and terrestrial weathering made similar contributions to CO2 removal through the Triassic and Jurassic, after which terrestrial weathering increased and seafloor weathering declined. We predict that basalts made a greater contribution to silicate weathering than granites through the Mesozoic, before the contribution of basalt weathering declined over the Cenozoic due to decreasing global basaltic area.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that progressive cooling of global climate since the Late Cretaceous results from decreasing partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2). However, details on how and why the carbon cycle evolved and how it would affect pCO2 have not been fully resolved. While the long-term decline of pCO2 might be caused by the decrease of volcanic degassing through the negative feedback between pCO2 and silicate weathering, seafloor spreading, the major control of CO2 degassing, seems to have remained relatively constant. Alternative explanation, known as ‘uplift driven climate change’ hypothesis, proposes that tectonic uplift may have enhanced the sink of atmospheric CO2 by silicate weathering, and thus produced the decline of pCO2. However, increasing weathering sink of CO2 could deplete atmosphere all of its CO2 within several million years while holding volcanic outgassing constant. In this work, major fluxes of long-term carbon cycle are calculated based on a reverse model constrained by marine C, Sr and Os isotopic records and the spreading rate of sea floor. Weathering of island basalt and continental silicate rocks are separated in the new model. The results indicate a long-term decline of island basalt weathering in consistent with the global cooling trend over the past 100 million years. Dramatic changes of the CO2 fluxes associated continental silicate weathering, reverse weathering, volcanic degassing and the growth of organic carbon reservoir have been observed. Disturbance of atmospheric CO2 cycle by these fluxes seems to be maintained by the concomitant adjustments of island basalt weathering that were sensitive to the pCO2 controlled environment factors such as temperature and runoff. The negative feedbacks between pCO2 and weathering of island basalt might have played a significant role in stabilizing the long-term carbon cycle.},

Quartz is a resistate, thus feldspars and glass represent approximately 75 percent of the labile minerals. The weathering characteristics of these constituents are summarized in the context of thermodynamic, mass balance and kinetic considerations. Experimentally determined release rate constants were used to predict the proportions of Ca, Na and K released by feldspars of plutonic rocks (granites to gabbros) to weathering solutions. The chemical weathering trends of the weathered residues, calculated from the kinetic data, conform closely to the initial trends observed in some recent weathering profiles, demonstrating the accuracy of the predictions. Since the weathering of feldspars is controlled by processes that should not change through geological time, the relative release rates of Ca, Na, and K from the feldspars of granitic rocks can be calculated for future and past episodes of continental weathering. Experimentally determined release rate constants are not available for a wide range of volcanic glass compositions, but the limited data indicate that compositional trends are predictable in weathering profiles developed on volcanic rocks. The kinetic data available for rhyolitic glasses accurately predict the initial weathering trends observed in a recent rhyolite weathering profile.},

For other areas, data scatter with either apparent increases or decreases of sediment yield for given CIA values. These areas are termed nonequilibrium denudation regions. Low sediment yields can be attributed to moderated erosion (either natural or human induced) and/or the incorporation of unweathered glacial debris. Accelerated erosion, resulting in high sediment yield, is primarily human-induced and results from cultivation and other land use. Each of these effects has a profound influence on global sediment discharge from the continents. Pre-human suspended sediment discharge from the continents is estimated to be  or about 0.6 the present discharge.},

	abstract = {Grain-size control on sediment composition is investigated in modern proximal sediment from the Sila Massif, where basic to felsic intrusive rocks are exposed in a Mediterranean humid–temperate upland climate. Samples were taken from small creeks and weathering profiles from three areas reflecting different bed rock compositions. Samples were separated into eleven grain size fractions from very coarse sand to clay and analyzed by (i) X-ray fluorescence for chemical composition and (ii) X-ray diffraction and Mineral Liberation Analysis for mineralogical composition. The chemical composition vs. grain size relations were modeled by compositional linear regression. Mineralogical composition of selected samples is used to substantiate the interpretations based on geochemistry.
Results
reveal a high degree of chemical weathering with chemical index of alteration (CIA) up to 92. High CIA values are restricted to the fine-grained fractions, while sand-sized sediment average at low to moderate CIA values ({\textasciitilde}60). Although strongly weathered, the three sample suites reflecting basic to felsic plutonic bed rock can be effectively discriminated across all grain-size classes using trace elements such as V, Rb, and Sr. Linear trend modeling and mineralogical data reflect similar patterns for all sample suites implying similar processes independent of source rock composition. This includes overall decrease of quartz and K-feldspar over the full grain-size range from very coarse sand to clay, which is contrasted by overall increase of sheet silicates from coarse to fine. Among the latter, increase of clay minerals strongly outpaces the increase of micas in silt to clay fractions. A more complex behavior is shown by plagioclase, which is most abundant in intermediate grain-size fractions for all sample suites. This is likely caused by initial hydrolysis along cleavage and twinning planes and subsequent breakage of plagioclase crystals into smaller fragments. Towards finer grain size, intense hydrolysis has destroyed most feldspars.},

	abstract = {Clastic sediment generation is controlled by physical and chemical processes acting in concert in most geological settings. In glacial settings, however, it is possible investigating the sole impact of mechanical processes such as comminution on sediment composition, as chemical processes are thought to be negligible in this environment. Comminution is a selective process in the sense that minerals behave differently under mechanical forcing and has yet not been thoroughly investigated under strict grain-size control. We sampled sediment from modern front and side moraines from six retreating glaciers in the Alps, that drain and erode either pure felsic crystalline rocks (granites, granodiorites, orthogneisses) or largely pure metamafic rocks (amphibolites and hornblende-rich gneisses). Samples were split in up to eleven grain-size fractions from very coarse sand to clay. Grain-size fractions were analysed for major and trace elements using X-ray fluorescence. Mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction and endmember modelling of geochemical data. Results reveal in general strong grain-size control on sediment composition and strikingly similar patterns for both source lithologies. Significant influence of chemical weathering and hydrodynamic sorting is ruled out. Zr/Zn ratio is found as a valuable proxy for grain size while Cr/Rb constitutes one of the rare discriminants between the two cases over the entire grain-size range. Most trace elements, however, are not suitable for source rock discrimination across grain size grades even in glacial environment and extreme proximity to the source. Consequently, bulk sediment geochemistry has only limited benefit in provenance studies unless the samples were analysed under strict grain-size control. The data can be modelled by linear regression with two components: (i) a linear trend describing preferential enrichment of phyllosilicates at the expense of quartz and feldspar towards finer fractions, and (ii) some breaks at certain grain-size thresholds. Due to the observed step functions the model describes a four-step enrichment-depletion pattern that is largely similar for the two source-rock cases: feldspar is highest in the very coarse to medium sand fraction; quartz is highest in very fine sand; epidote, garnet, hornblende, apatite are highest and plagioclase is relatively high in the silt range; sheet silicates (chlorite, biotite, muscovite) are highest in the clay fraction. The observed pattern describes the process of comminution, i.e. the impact of mechanical forces on minerals with contrasting durability: the most durable minerals like quartz are concentrated close to their inherited grain-sizes while less durable minerals are enriched in silt fractions, and least durable minerals (i.e. sheet silicates) are enriched in the very fine silt to clay fractions. The latter, not chemical weathering causes an increase in chemical index of alteration (CIA) values up to {\textasciitilde}63 at the finest grain-size grades. The model provides a quantitative description of the composition to grain-size relations and is thought to form a valuable module for building comprehensive sediment generation models that describe the entire network of sediment production processes from source to sink.},

	abstract = {The geochemical composition of siliciclastic sediments correlates strongly with grain size. Hence, geochemical composition may serve as a grain-size proxy. In the absence of grain-size variations, geochemical data of siliciclastic sediments may be used to characterise size-independent processes, i.e., sediment provenance, weathering, mixing, shape/density sorting and diagenesis. In general, however, geochemical data sets contain both types of information. In order to formalise interpretation of geochemical data, we propose a mathematical method to decompose the total geochemical variability of a series of genetically related specimens into a grain-size dependent (the shared signal) and a grain-size independent part (the residual signal). The former may serve as a proxy for grain size whereas the latter represents geochemical variability that would have been observed if all sediments would have had the same grain-size distribution. The two data sets are jointly decomposed by means of Partial Least Squares (PLS) and orthogonal projection. Subsequently, the presence of significant grain-size independent geochemical variability in the residual signal is determined in a statistically rigorous manner using a χ2-test. Using a synthetic example, we show that the residual record effectively reveals an imposed provenance signal which could not have been resolved from the geochemical or grain-size data sets individually. We analysed the relation between grain size and geochemical composition in three Quaternary marine sediment cores located offshore West Africa and South America (GeoB7920-2, GeoB9508-5 and GeoB7139-2). Both sites are characterised by biogenic sediment input, in addition to fluvial and aeolian sediment input from the continent. It was found that all cores show a strong, but different correlation between the mean grain size and the bulk geochemical composition. These results demonstrate that geochemical grain-size proxies are empirical and site-specific. It was also found that the geochemical and grain-size data in cores GeoB7920-2 and GeoB7139-2 do not contain unique information, whereas in core GeoB9508-5 Ti varies independently from the grain size. This residual Ti-signal correlates with the transport mechanism, as demonstrated by statistically different values of aeolian and fluvial-dominated sediments. However, a unique interpretation of this residual signal in terms of the postulated grain-size independent mechanisms could not be provided without additional information. We conclude that the proposed model facilitates identification and validation of different element ratios as grain-size proxies and, more importantly, as proxies for size-independent processes. For this reason, the model paves the way for rigorous analysis of multi-proxy data, which are widely used in palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic research.},

	abstract = {Chemical weathering indices are useful tools in characterizing weathering profiles and determining the extent of weathering. However, the predictive performance of the conventional indices is critically dependent on the composition of the unweathered parent rock. To overcome this limitation, the present paper introduces an alternative statistical empirical index of chemical weathering that is extracted by the principal component analysis (PCA) of a large dataset derived from unweathered igneous rocks and their weathering profiles. The PCA analysis yields two principal components (PC1 and PC2), which capture 39.23\% and 35.17\% of total variability, respectively. The extent of weathering is reflected by variation along PC1, primarily due to the loss of Na2O and CaO during weathering. In contrast, PC2 is the direction along which the projections of unweathered felsic, intermediate and mafic igneous rocks appear to be best discriminated; therefore, PC1 and PC2 represent independent latent variables that correspond to the extent of weathering and the chemistry of the unweathered parent rock. Subsequently, PC1 and PC2 were then mapped onto a ternary diagram (MFW diagram). The M and F vertices characterize mafic and felsic rock source, respectively, while the W vertex identifies the degree of weathering of these sources, independent of the chemistry of the unweathered parent rock. The W index has a number of significant properties that are not found in conventional weathering indices. First, the W index is sensitive to chemical changes that occur during weathering because it is based on eight major oxides, whereas most conventional indices are defined by between two and four oxides. Second, the W index provides robust results even for highly weathered sesquioxide-rich samples. Third, the W index is applicable to a wide range of felsic, intermediate and mafic igneous rock types. Finally, the MFW diagram is expected to facilitate provenance analysis of sedimentary rocks by identifying their weathering trends and thereby enabling a backward estimate of the composition of the unweathered source rock.},

However the evolution of weathering through time and its response to external forcing such as changes in climate remain poorly constrained. In this work, a composite sediment record from the Bay of Bengal is used to document the evolution of chemical weathering in the Himalayan system (Himalayan range and Indo-Gangetic floodplain), the world largest sediment conveyor to the oceans, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The degree of weathering of the sediments is documented using mobile to immobile ratios such as K/Si and H2O+/Si as well as detrital calcite abundance. Robust weathering proxies are derived by correcting the chemical composition of sediment for sorting effects that occur during transport and deposition. The Bay of Bengal record is also further compared to the chemical composition of modern river sediments from the Ganga and Brahmaputra basin. Weathering proxies all indicate that the sediments exported by the Ganga and Brahmaputra Rivers became increasingly weathered over the past ∼21kyr, whereas, Sr, Nd and major elements suggest a constant sediment provenance in the system over the last 21kyr. These changes in the degree of weathering of the sediments show that the weathering flux exported by the system to the Indian Ocean during the LGM was significantly lower than at present and demonstrate that chemical weathering in continental scale basins such as the Ganga and Brahmaputra responds to Late Quaternary climate changes.},

We chose a classical model covering grain sizes from fine gravel to clay, and distinguishing five types of grains (rock fragments, poly- and mono crystalline quartz, feldspar and mica/clay). A compositional linear process is fitted here to a digitized version of this model, by (i) applying classical regression to the set of all pairwise log-ratios of the 5-part composition against grain size, and (ii) looking for the compositions that best approximate the set of estimated parameters, one acting as slope and one as intercept. The method is useful even in the presence of several missing values. The linear fit suggests that the relative influence of the processes controlling the relationship between grain size and sediment composition is constant along most of the grain size spectrum.},

	abstract = {Fluvial landscapes diversified markedly over the 250 million years between the Cambrian and Pennsylvanian periods. The diversification occurred in tandem with the evolution of vascular plants and expanding vegetation cover. In the absence of widespread vegetation, landscapes during the Cambrian and Ordovican periods were dominated by rivers with wide sand-beds and aeolian tracts. During the late Silurian and Devonian periods, the appearance of vascular plants with root systems was associated with the development of channelled sand-bed rivers, meandering rivers and muddy floodplains. The widespread expansion of trees by the Early Pennsylvanian marks the appearance of narrow fixed channels, some representing anabranching systems, and braided rivers with vegetated islands. We conclude that the development of roots stabilized the banks of rivers and streams. The subsequent appearance of woody debris led to log jams that promoted the rapid formation of new river channels. Our contention is supported by studies of modern fluvial systems and laboratory experiments. In turn, fluvial styles influenced plant evolution as new ecological settings developed along the fluvial systems. We suggest that terrestrial plant and landscape evolution allowed colonization by an increasingly diverse array of organisms.},

	abstract = {Sulfur, the 10th most abundant element in the universe and the 14th most abundant element in the Earth’s crust, is the defining element of sulfide minerals and provides insights into the origins of these minerals through its stable isotopes. The insights come from variations in the isotopic composition of sulfide minerals and related compounds such as sulfate minerals or aqueous sulfur species, caused by preferential partitioning of isotopes among sulfur-bearing phases, known as fractionation. These variations arise from differences in temperature, or more importantly, oxidation and reduction reactions acting upon the sulfur. The oxidation and reduction reactions can occur at high temperature, such as in igneous systems, at intermediate temperatures, such as in hydrothermal systems, and at low temperature during sedimentary diagenesis. At high temperatures, the reactions tend to occur under equilibrium conditions, whereas at low temperatures, disequilibrium is prevalent. In addition, upper atmospheric processes also lead to isotopic fractionations that locally appear in the geologic record.

Sulfur isotope geochemistry as a subdiscipline of the geological sciences began in the late 1940s and early 1950s with early publications by Thode et al. (1949) and Szabo et al. (1950) on natural variations of sulfur isotopes, and Macnamara and Thode (1950) on the isotopic composition of terrestrial and meteoritic sulfur. Sakai (1957) presented an early scientific summary of sulfur isotope geochemistry, with a particular emphasis on high-temperature processes. Thode et al. (1961) also presented an early summary, but with an emphasis on low-temperature processes. Both of these summaries outlined salient aspects of the global sulfur cycle. Sulfur isotope geochemistry understandably has had a long history of application to the study of sulfide-bearing mineral deposits. Early noteworthy papers include those by Kulp et al. (1956) and Jensen (1957, 1959). Similarly, there is also a legacy of contributions to understanding …},

Our approach is especially amenable to a spreadsheet program and can solve complex geological histories involving variable heating and cooling rates.

	abstract = {Since 1872, approximately 185 metric tons of gold and a significant amount of silver have been won from numerous stratiform ore bodies within the Pilgrim's Rest goldfield. The epigenetic stratiform ore bodies are found primarily in the Malmani Dolomite Subgroup, a laterally extensive Lower Proterozoic carbonate platform succession. A strong relationship exists between the presence of stratiform ore bodies and environment of deposition and structural deformation. Analysis of the host sediments indicates deposition in a retrogradational, followed by an aggradational, sequence that comprises supratidal (sabkha) siliciclastic sediments to midshelf carbonates. The retrogradational and aggradational sequences are characterized by numerous higher frequency transgressive and regressive cycles. Mineralization is, with few exceptions, restricted to shallow-water siliciclastic sediments; deeper water carbonates are barren. More importantly, siliciclastic mudstones and sandstones have acted as zones of detachment for thin-skinned thrust-fault deformation, resulting in the development of conformable passageways in which fluids concentrated their auriferous lodes. Evidence of shallow hinterland-dipping duplex, antiformal stack, and imbricate thrust systems abounds in several underground and field exposures. The gold-silver emplacement model for the Pilgrim's Rest goldfield infers fluids derived from a deep-seated magmatic source. Oxygen-isotopic compositions of the mineralizing fluids, recalculated from δ18O quartz (+ 12.1‰ to + 19.5‰), point to a magmatic source and subsequent mixing with saline, evolved formation water. A magmatic origin is also supported by the high homogenization temperature gradient displayed by the fluid inclusions (100°C/km). The Bushveld Igneous Complex (Rustenburg Layered Suite) to the west of Pilgrim's Rest is thought to be the source of the auriferous hydrothermal solutions, and its emplacement was the driving mechanism of thrust-fault deformation in the Pilgrim's Rest goldfield.},

	abstract = {We utilize carbonate clumped isotope thermometry to explore the diagenetic and thermal histories of exhumed brachiopods, crinoids, cements, and host rock in the Permian Palmarito Formation, Venezuela, and the Carboniferous Bird Spring Formation, Nevada, USA. Carbonate components in the Palmarito Formation, buried to {\textasciitilde}4 km depth, yield statistically indistinguishable clumped isotope temperatures [T(∆47)] ranging from 86 to 122 °C. Clumped isotope temperatures of components in the more deeply buried Bird Spring Formation ({\textgreater}5 km) range from {\textasciitilde}100 to 165 °C and differ by component type, with brachiopods and pore-filling cements yielding the highest T(∆47) (mean = 153 and 141 °C, respectively) and crinoids and host rock yielding significantly cooler T(∆47) (mean = 103 and 114 °C). New high-resolution thermal histories are coupled with kinetic models to predict the extent of solid-state C-O bond reordering during burial and exhumation for both sites. Application of these models, termed “THRMs” (thermal history reordering models), suggests that brachiopods in the Palmarito Formation experienced partial bond reordering without complete equilibration of clumped isotopes at maximum burial temperature. In contrast, clumped isotope bonds of brachiopods from the Bird Spring Formation completely equilibrated at maximum burial temperature, and now reflect blocking temperatures achieved during cooling. The 40–50-°C-cooler clumped isotope temperatures measured in Bird Spring Formation crinoids and host rock can be explained by recrystallization and cementation during shallow burial combined with a greater inherent resistance to solid-state reordering than brachiopods.},

The sulfur cycle impacts the global carbon cycle and climate primarily through the remineralization of organic carbon. Over geological timescales, cycling of sulfur is closely tied to the redox state of Earth's exosphere through the burial of oxidized (sulfate) and reduced (sulfide) sulfur species in marine sediments. Biological sulfur cycling is associated with isotopic fractionations that can be used to trace the fluxes through various metabolic pathways. The resulting isotopic data provide insights into sulfur cycling in both modern and ancient environments via isotopic signatures in sedimentary sulfate and sulfide phases. Here, we review the deep-time δ34S record of marine sulfates and sulfides in light of recent advances in understanding how isotopic signatures are generated by microbial activity, how these signatures are encoded in marine sediments, and how they may be altered following deposition. The resulting picture shows a sulfur cycle intimately coupled to ambient carbon cycling, where sulfur isotopic records preserved in sedimentary rocks are critically dependent on sedimentological and geochemical conditions (e.g., iron availability) during deposition.},

	abstract = {Hopanes and steranes found in Archean rocks have been presented as key evidence supporting the early rise of oxygenic photosynthesis and eukaryotes, but the syngeneity of these hydrocarbon biomarkers is controversial. To resolve this debate, we performed a multilaboratory study of new cores from the Pilbara Craton, Australia, that were drilled and sampled using unprecedented hydrocarbon-clean protocols. Hopanes and steranes in rock extracts and hydropyrolysates from these new cores were typically at or below our femtogram detection limit, but when they were detectable, they had total hopane ({\textless}37.9 pg per gram of rock) and total sterane ({\textless}32.9 pg per gram of rock) concentrations comparable to those measured in blanks and negative control samples. In contrast, hopanes and steranes measured in the exteriors of conventionally drilled and curated rocks of stratigraphic equivalence reach concentrations of 389.5 pg per gram of rock and 1,039 pg per gram of rock, respectively. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and diamondoids, which exceed blank concentrations, exhibit individual concentrations up to 80 ng per gram of rock in rock extracts and up to 1,000 ng per gram of rock in hydropyrolysates from the ultraclean cores. These results demonstrate that previously studied Archean samples host mixtures of biomarker contaminants and indigenous overmature hydrocarbons. Therefore, existing lipid biomarker evidence cannot be invoked to support the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis and eukaryotes by ∼2.7 billion years ago. Although suitable Proterozoic rocks exist, no currently known Archean strata lie within the appropriate thermal maturity window for syngenetic hydrocarbon biomarker preservation, so future exploration for Archean biomarkers should screen for rocks with milder thermal histories.},

	abstract = {Not a single paleosol had been described from rocks of Ediacaran age until 2011, but 354 Ediacaran paleosols have been described by 20 different authors since then. Some of these newly recognized paleosols have proven controversial, so this paper reviews 20 distinct tests to determine whether a particular Ediacaran bed could be a paleosol, or not. One problem has been that Ediacaran paleosols are not precisely like modern soils because they lack root traces, a diagnostic feature of Silurian and geologically younger paleosols. The principal problem for recognition of some Ediacaran paleosols is the occurrence in them of megafossils assumed to have been marine, although most of these fossils remain problematic for both biological and ecological affinities. Not all the tests discussed here are diagnostic of paleosols, some are ranked permissive or persuasive. Permissive conditions for paleosols include ripple marks, hummocky bedding, pyritic limestones, acritarchs or thalloid fossils, low strontium isotopic ratios, high δ26Mg ratios, and red color. Persuasive tests include loessites, tsunamites, desert playa minerals, low boron content, high δ10B isotopic ratios, high carbon/sulfur ratios, and very low total/reactive iron ratios. Diagnostic tests include matrix-supported lapilli or crystal tuff parent materials, ice wedges and other cryoturbation, sepic birefringence fabrics, evaporitic sand crystals, and negative geochemical strain and mass transfer, and highly correlated δ13C and δ18O. Like other geological periods, the Ediacaran is known from a variety of marine and non-marine paleoenvironments},

It is composed of 14 third-order sequences that develop from a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp to a steepened margin followed by a rimmed margin that separated lagoonal environments from the open ocean. Drowning of the platform coincided with deposition of banded iron-formation across the Kaapvaal Craton. The geometry and stacking of these sequences are consistent with more recent patterns of carbonate accumulation, demonstrating that Neoarchean carbonate accumulation responded to subsidence, sea level change, and carbonate production similarly to Proterozoic and Phanerozoic platforms. The similarity of carbonate platform geometry through time, even with significant changes in dominant biota, demonstrates that rimmed margins are localized primarily by physiochemical conditions rather than growth dynamics of specific organisms.
Stratigraphic patterns during deposition of the Schmidtsdrift and Campbellrand-Malmani subgroups are most consistent with variable thinning of the Kaapvaal Craton during extrusion of the {\textasciitilde}2.7 Ga Ventersdorp lavas. Although depositional patterns are consistent with rifting of the western margin of the Kaapvaal Craton during this time, a rift-to-drift transition is not required to explain subsidence. Heating and thinning during Ventersdorp time can produce the observed thermal subsidence from {\textasciitilde}2.7 to {\textasciitilde}2.45 Ga if the thermal diffusivity of the craton was moderately low.},

The water table was generally high but flashy river discharge resulted in deposition of thin (up to 3 m) laterally extensive (hundreds to thousands of metres) sheets of medium-coarse sandstone with dominant trough cross-bedding and subordinate planar cross-bedding and parallel laminated beds. In the absence of vegetation and levees, floods were virtually unconfined and current directions are locally unimodal with narrow variation. Flood waters were sometimes diverted by aeolian surface morphology. Similar mixed fluvial and aeolian environments are considered to have been frequent in a wide range of climatic regimes prior to the advent of abundant land plants.},

	abstract = {Carbonate clumped-isotope geothermometry is a tool used to reconstruct formation or (re)equilibration temperatures of carbonate bearing minerals, including carbonate groups substituted into apatite. It is based on the preference for isotopologues with multiple heavy isotopes (for example, 13C16O218O2− groups) to be more abundant at equilibrium than would be expected if all isotopes were randomly distributed amongst all carbonate groups. Because this preference is only a function of temperature, excesses of multiply substituted species can be used to calculate formation temperatures without knowledge of the isotopic composition of water from which the mineral precipitated or other phases with which it may have equilibrated. However, the measured temperature could be modified after mineral growth if exchange of isotopes amongst carbonate groups within the mineral has occurred through internal isotope-exchange reactions. Because these exchange reactions occur through thermally activated processes, their rates depend on temperature and increase at higher temperatures. Thus internal isotope-exchange reactions could lead to effective re-equilibration at high temperatures, overprinting the original temperatures recorded during mineral growth. We measured clumped-isotope temperatures in carbonate bearing minerals (including apatites) from several carbonatites to constrain the kinetics of these internal isotope-exchange reactions. We observe two key trends for clumped-isotope temperatures in carbonatites: (i) clumped-isotope temperatures of apatites and carbonate-bearing minerals decrease with increasing intrusion depth and (ii) apatites record lower clumped-isotope temperatures than carbonate minerals from the same intrusion. We additionally conducted heating experiments at different temperatures to derive the temperature dependence for the rate constants that describe the alteration of clumped-isotope temperatures with time in calcites and apatites. We find that calcites exhibit complex kinetics as has been seen in previous studies. To quantify these results, we constructed a model that incorporates both diffusion of isotopes through the crystal lattice and isotope-exchange reactions between adjacent carbonate groups. We tested this model through comparison to previous measurements of optical calcites and brachiopods and to samples with known cooling histories and find that the model is able to reasonably capture kinetic data from previous experiments and the observed clumped-isotope temperatures of calcites assuming geologically reasonable cooling rates. A similar model for apatite over-predicts the observed clumped-isotope temperatures found in natural samples; we hypothesize this discrepancy is the result of annealing of radiation damage in our experiments, which lowers the diffusivity and rate of isotope exchange of carbonate groups compared to damaged natural samples. Finally, we constructed models to explore how heating can alter recorded clumped-isotope temperatures. Our model predicts that samples change in clumped-isotope temperatures in two stages. The first stage changes the recorded clumped isotope temperatures by {\textless}1 °C if held at 75 °C for 100 million years and by up to ∼40 °C if held at 120 °C, but the clumped-isotope temperatures does not reach ambient values through this low-temperature mechanism. A second, slower change becomes effective at temperatures above 150 °C and can take the measured clumped-isotope temperature up to the true ambient temperature. This result implies that old (hundreds of million years) samples that have only experienced mild ({\textless}100-125 °C) thermal histories could exhibit small but measurable (order 10 °C) changes in their clumped-isotope temperatures. We compared this heating model to clumped-isotope measurements from paleosol samples from the Siwalik Basin in Nepal, which were buried up to 5 km and then rapidly exhumed to the surface; these samples often do not give reasonable surface temperatures. The modeled temperatures agree with measured temperatures of these samples, suggesting that partial re-equilibration during shallow crustal burial is responsible for their elevated clumped-isotope temperatures.},

	abstract = {The early Paleozoic Tumblagooda Sandstone outcrops principally in the vicinity of the Murchison
River in Kalbarri National Park, Western Australia. It contains a great variety of trace fossils that
provide  a  unique  insight  into  the  activities  of  early  invaders  of  the  terrestrial  environment,  and
may record one of the earliest known freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. The traces reveal that
this  nascent  terrestrial  fauna  was  dominated  by  arthropods.  In  outcrop  the  sandstones  are  more
than  1  km  thick  and  comprise  predominantly  mixed  fluvial  and  eolian  deposits.  The  age  of  the
Tumblagooda  Sandstone  has  been  the  subject  of  much  debate.  Initial  analysis  of  the  trace-fossil
assemblage suggested a Late Silurian age. Preliminary work on conodont faunas in sediments of
the conformably overlying Dirk Hartog Group also indicated a Silurian age. However, arguments
have  been  made  for  an  older,  Ordovician  age  based  on  paleomagnetic  and  pedostratigraphic
studies. In this review it is argued that deposition is linked to the known ages of regional uplift of
the  hinterland,  and  thus  inferred  to  be  Early  to  mid-Silurian.  A  previous  study  recognised  two
distinct trace-fossil assemblages. One, comprising a mixture of burrows and arthropod trackways,
represents  a  freshwater/terrestrial  ecosystem  that  inhabited  sands  interpreted  as  having  been
deposited in broad, low sinuosity, braided fluvial channels, between mixed eolian and water-lain
sandsheets,  small  eolian  dunes  and  flooded  interdune,  and  deflation  hollows.  The  major
bioturbator was Heimdallia. Other burrows include Tumblagoodichnus, Beaconites and Diplocraterion.
A  variety  of  arthropod  trackways,  predominantly  Diplichnites,  formed  on  water-lain  sands  and
foreset beds of eolian dunes. Other tracks include  Siskemia and possible examples of Paleohelcura
and Protichnites. Other arthropod traces include Rusophycus and  Cruziana. Likely arthropod track
makers  include  myriapods,  eurypterids,  euthycarcinoids  and  xiphosurids.  A  single  trackway  is
interpreted as having been made by a tetrapod and as such pushes back the record of this group
from the mid-Devonian to the Early–mid-Silurian. This trace fossil assemblage can be assigned to
the  Scoyenia  ichnofacies.  A  second  trace  fossil  assemblage,  assignable  to  the  Skolithos  ichnofacies
occurs  higher  in  the  section,  in  strata  traditionally  interpreted  as  having  been  deposited  in  a
marginal  fluvial-marine  environment.  The  ichnofacies  is  dominated  by  burrows,  especially
Skolithos, but also Diplocraterion, Daedalus and Lunatubichnus. Rare locomotory traces are assignable
to Diplichnites and Aulichnites. Preservation of the arthropod trackways in the Scoyenia ichnofacies
was facilitated by the nature of the fluvial/eolian environment. Many of the tracks show indication
of  having  been  created  subaerially  on  wet  sand  surfaces,  and  preserved  by  a  covering  of  fine,
eolian sand. The presence of extensive dwelling burrows and terrestrial trackways in the Scoyenia
ichnofacies  represents  arguably  the  earliest  known  freshwater/terrestrial  ecosystem.  Moreover,  it
supports the view that one of the major steps in evolution, the colonisation of land by animals, may
have been from rivers, rather than directly from the sea.},

	abstract = {This study investigates iron (Fe) and sulfur (S) cycling in sediments from the eutrophic Peel–Harvey Estuary in Western Australia, which is subject to localized accumulation of strongly reducing, organic- and sulfide-rich sediments. Sedimentary iron was mostly present in highly reactive form (on average 73\% of total Fe) and showed extensive sulfidization even in surface sediments, despite being overlain by a well-mixed oxygenated water column. This indicates that, under eutrophic marine conditions, Fe sulfidization may be driven by reductive processes in the sediment without requiring oxygen depletion in the overlying waters. Strong enrichments in iron monosulfide (FeS \&gt; 300 μmol g−1) were observed in fine-grained sediment intervals up to 45 cm depth. This metastable Fe sulfide is commonly restricted to thin subsurface sediment intervals, below which pyrite (FeS2) dominates. Our findings suggest inhibition of the dissolution–precipitation processes that replace FeS with FeS2 in sediments. Rates of pyrite formation based on the FeS2 profiles were much lower than those predicted by applying commonly used kinetic equations for pyrite formation. Dissolved H2S was present at millimolar levels throughout the investigated sediment profiles. This may indicate that (i) pyrite formation via reaction between dissolved Fe (including Fe clusters) and H2S was limited by low availability of dissolved Fe or (ii) reaction kinetics of pyrite formation via the H2S pathway may be relatively slow in natural reducing sediments. We propose that rapid burial of the FeS under anoxic conditions in these organic-rich reducing sediments minimizes the potential for pyrite formation, possibly by preventing dissolution of FeS or by limiting the availability of oxidized sulfur species that are required for pyrite formation via the polysulfide pathway.},

Rb-Sr whole-rock measurements are reported for shales and siltstones from the Torridonian sediments of north-west Scotland. Excellent isochrons are obtained whose slope is interpreted as being proportional to the time of diagenesis of the sediments, closely following deposition and compaction. The Lower Torridonian of Stoer, below the recently discovered stratigraphical unconformity, gives an isochron age of 935±24 m.y. The Upper Torridonian Applecross Formation near Gairloch, above the unconformity, gives an isochron age of 761±17 m.y. The latter isochron, when combined with several points from the Cailleach Head Formation, near the top of the Torridonian succession, yields a composite value of 751±24 m.y.
From these age data it appears that the unconformity between the rapidly deposited Lower and Upper Torridonian sediments may reflect a time interval of about 170 m.y. This is in general accord with the very different palaeomagnetic pole positions which have been reported for the Lower and Upper Torridonian.},

Typical basinal brines in Silurian–Devonian formations of the interior Illinois basin, United States, show the same compositional trends as those of progressively evaporated CaCl2-rich Silurian seawater. Chemical deviations can be accounted for quantitatively by brine-rock reactions during burial (dolomitization, dolomite and K-feldspar cement).

	abstract = {The chemical evolution of seawater during the Phanerozoic is still a matter of debate. We have assembled and critically analyzed the available data for the composition of fluid inclusions in marine halite and for the mineralogy of marine evaporites. The composition of fluid inclusions in primary marine halite reveals two major long-term cycles in the chemistry of seawater during the past 600 myr. The concentration of Mg2+, Ca2+, and SO42− has varied quite dramatically. The Mg2+ concentration in seawater during most of the early Paleozoic and Jurassic to Cretaceous was as low as 30 to 40 mmol/kg H2O; it reached maximum values ≥50 mmol/kg H2O during the Late Neoproterozoic and Permian. The Ca2+ concentration in seawater during the Phanerozoic has reached maximum values two to three times greater than the concentration in seawater today (10.6 mmol/kg H2O), whereas SO42− concentrations may have been as low as 5 to 10 mmol/kg H2O (a third to a fifth of the modern value) during the Jurassic and Early Paleozoic. The Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio in seawater ranged from 1 to 1.5 during the early to middle Paleozoic and Jurassic-Cretaceous to a near-modern value of 5.2 during the Late Neoproterozoic and Permian. This change in seawater Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio is consistent with the notion of alternating “calcite-aragonite seas” recorded in oölites and marine carbonate cements.

Several models have been proposed to explain the chemical evolution of seawater. These have invoked significant changes in one or more of the major geochemical processes that control the composition of seawater. The pattern and magnitude of the variations in the composition of seawater proposed in this study are similar to those proposed elsewhere that suggest that seawater fluxes through midocean ridges have played a major role in the evolution of seawater during the past 600 myr. Two Phanerozoic supercycles of the Earth’s exogenic processes were recognized in the literature that are caused by mantle convection and plate activity. The composition of seawater has apparently undergone dramatic secular changes in phase with these supercycles and as a consequence of biological evolution. Analyses of fluid inclusions containing unevaporated seawater and a better understanding of the processes that affect the composition of seawater are needed to refine our understanding of the history of Phanerozoic seawater.},

	abstract = {The late Paleocene to the early Eocene (∼58–52 Ma) was marked by significant changes in global climate and carbon cycling. The evidence for these changes includes stable isotope records that reveal prominent decreases in δ18O and δ13C, suggesting a rise in Earth's surface temperature (∼4°C) and a drop in net carbon output from the ocean and atmosphere. Concurrently, deep-sea carbonate records at several sites indicate a deepening of the calcite compensation depth (CCD). Here we investigate possible causes (e.g., increased volcanic degassing or decreased net organic burial) for these observations, but from a new perspective. The basic model employed is a modified version of GEOCARB III. However, we have coupled this well-known geochemical model to LOSCAR (Long-term Ocean-atmosphere Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir model), which enables simulation of seawater carbonate chemistry, the CCD, and ocean δ13C. We have also added a capacitor, in this case represented by gas hydrates, that can store and release13C-depleted carbon to and from the shallow geosphere over millions of years. We further consider accurate input data (e.g., δ13C of carbonate) on a currently accepted timescale that spans an interval much longer than the perturbation. Several different scenarios are investigated with the goal of consistency amongst inferred changes in temperature, the CCD, and surface ocean and deep ocean δ13C. The results strongly suggest that a decrease in net organic carbon burial drove carbon cycle changes during the late Paleocene and early Eocene, although an increase in volcanic activity might have contributed. Importantly, a drop in net organic carbon burial may represent increased oxidation of previously deposited organic carbon, such as stored in peat or gas hydrates. The model successfully recreates trends in Earth surface warming, as inferred from δ18O records, the CCD, and δ13C. At the moment, however, our coupled modeling effort cannot reproduce the magnitude of change in all these records collectively. Similar problems have arisen in simulations of short-term hyperthermal events during the early Paleogene (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum), suggesting one or more basic issues with data interpretation or geochemical modeling remain.},

	abstract = {Apatite fission-track (AFT) analysis has been widely used during the past 30+ years to constrain the low-temperature thermal histories of many igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks in a wide range of geological settings. Applicable geological settings include orogenic belts, rifted margins, faults, sedimentary basins, cratons, and mineral deposits. The types of geologic problems that can be addressed include the timing and rates of tectonic events, sedimentary basin evolution, the timing of hydrocarbon generation and ore mineralization, the absolute age of volcanic deposits, the effects of major climatic changes on the near-surface geothermal gradient, and long-term landscape evolution. Early work by Naeser (1967) and Wagner (1968, 1969) first established the basic procedures that enabled the fission-track dating method to be applied routinely to these geologic problems. Fleischer et al. (1975) summarized the early studies of the broader discipline of nuclear-track detection in different solid-state materials. More recent comprehensive overviews of fission-track applications have been provided by Naeser and McCulloh (1989), Wagner and Van den haute (1992), Gallagher et al. (1998), Van den haute and De Corte (1998), Dumitru (2000), and Gleadow et al. (2002).

Etched, natural fission tracks in several apatite grains are shown in Figure 1⇓. Successful AFT analysis is limited by the following: 1) the availability of apatite from which useful AFT data can be obtained, often due to a lack of apatite of sufficient grain size and quality within available rock types, or, alternatively, the lack of available rock samples due to minimal outcrop exposure or other reasons, 2) economic considerations in terms of the time and money required to obtain sufficient AFT data, 3) the inherent limitations of AFT data to resolve geological thermal history information, often related to limited numbers of accumulated spontaneous fission tracks due to …},

An outcrop at Potters Mills, central Pennsylvania, has previously been attributed to a terrestrial environment. Because this outcrop contains numerous sub-vertical burrows and evidence for pedogenesis, it has regularly been cited as the oldest evidence for several aspects of continental ecosystem development, including the first evidence for terrestrial infauna and animal-plant interactions. We present evidence from both original fieldwork and published literature that collectively sheds considerable doubt on previous interpretations. The evidence suggests that the Juniata Formation at Potters Mills was deposited in a marginal marine setting and, as such, no evidence for early life on land can be inferred from its strata. This has significant implications for the numerous studies that have cited the Juniata Formation as providing a key record of early terrestrial evolution. Removing it from the dataset of studies that deal with the history of life on land, we conclude that currently the majority of fossil evidence from localities worldwide supports the appearance of terrestrial infauna and animal-plant interactions in the Silurian–Devonian.},

	abstract = {Much of what we know about the history of Earth’s climate derives from the chemistry of carbonate minerals in the sedimentary record. The oxygen isotopic compositions (δ18O) of calcitic marine fossils and cements have been widely used as a proxy for past seawater temperatures, but application of this proxy to deep geologic time is complicated by diagenetic alteration and uncertainties in the δ18O of seawater in the past. Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry provides an independent estimate of the temperature of the water from which a calcite phase precipitated, and allows direct calculation of the δ18O of the water. The clumped isotope composition of calcites is also highly sensitive to recrystallization and can help diagnose different modes of diagenetic alteration, enabling evaluation of preservation states and identification of the most pristine materials from within a sample set—critical information for assessing the quality of paleoproxy data generated from carbonates.

We measured the clumped isotope composition of a large suite of calcitic fossils (primarily brachiopods and corals), sedimentary grains, and cements from Silurian (ca. 433 Ma) stratigraphic sections on the island of Gotland, Sweden. Substantial variability in clumped isotope temperatures suggests differential preservation with alteration largely tied to rock-buffered diagenesis, complicating the generation of a stratigraphically resolved climate history through these sections. Despite the generally high preservation quality of samples from these sections, micro-scale observations of calcite fabric and trace metal composition using electron backscatter diffraction and electron microprobe analysis suggest that only a subset of relatively pristine samples retain primary clumped isotope signatures. These samples indicate that Silurian tropical oceans were likely warm (33 ± 7 °C) and similar in oxygen isotopic composition to that estimated for a “modern” ice-free world (δ18OVSMOW of −1.1 ± 1.3‰). This result joins the growing body of evidence that suggests the δ18O of Earth’s ocean waters has remained broadly constant through time.},

They contain organic carbon microfossils claimed to be non-marine and to include eukaryotes. We consider the evidence for terrestrial interpretations from each formation of the Torridonian Supergroup. The range of sedimentary structures and the boron content of illite led us to the overall conclusion that, based on the currently available evidence, the Torridonian Supergroup was probably entirely non-marine. Evidence for terrestrial life in these rocks comes from microbially induced sedimentary structures, including wrinkle structures with reticulate and elephant skin fabrics. Organic remains and microscopic carbonaceous compressions mostly reported from phosphates in the grey shales of the Stoer, Aultbea and Applecross formations are dominated by sphaeromorph acritarchs. The Diabaig phosphatic lagerstätte includes three-dimensional preservation of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, providing remarkable insights into non-marine life around 1 billion years ago.

The original depository probably extended across the entire 600,000 km2 surface area of the craton and beyond. The buildup consists essentially of two major lithofacies assemblages, namely a basinal, non-stromatolitic, laminated carbonate and shale sequence (with minor chert, iron-formation and mafic tuff interbeds) off the craton to the west, and a shallow-water stromatolitic carbonate sequence on the craton proper. Growth faults along the edge of the craton controlled the platform margin defined by columnar stromatolite, oolite and carbonate arenite shoal deposits. These are flanked basinward by “reef-like” giant subtidal stromatolitic mounds elongated perpendicular to the platform margin and grading into slope deposits consisting of laminated carbonates with interbeds of chaotic dolomite breccia and conophyton stromatolites. Platform lagoonal deposits consist of dark grey, laminoid fenestrate, stratified stromatolites interfingering to the interior of the craton with intertidal to supratidal, light grey cherty dolomite units with a variety of structures such as domal and stratified stromatolites, laminoid fenestrae, tepee structures and flat pebble conglomerates. The buildup consisted primarily of limestone which was replaced by early diagenetic dolomite. The chemical composition of the dolomite is related to depofacies. Platform margin and lagoonal dolomites are manganese-rich, basinal dolomites are iron-rich and intertidal to supratidal deposits are virtually free of iron and manganeses. Indications are that the carbonate buildup developed from an early carbonate ramp stage into a mature rimmed carbonate shelf. Eventually the carbonate shelf was drowned by a major transgression followed by the deposition of the Kuruman iron-formation.},

Previously of uncertain affinity, it is now identified as Pseudokomewuia (Pseudokomewuia) aff. granulata He 1980. The variety of other biological groups that are represented by fossils in the succession provides a basis for making observations on ecological associations and climatic conditions during the period of deposition of the sediments. The cysts do not occur in the alluvial (floodplain) and poorly laminated, early lacustrine facies that underlie the varved unit, nor in the overlying late lacustrine, oxidised, silty clay facies. They are associated only with sediment-couplets considered to reflect accumulation in temperature-stratified water approximately 8–12 m deep that overturned periodically. It is likely that the dinoflagellates inhabited the warm, epilimnic, oxygenated layer above the cool deep water in which oxygen levels were low, rendering this environment inhospitable to both animals and plants, but favouring the preservation of organic matter. Their absence from the unlaminated deposits of the early and late lacustrine facies may not mean that the motile dinoflagellates were not present in the shallower waters they represent but simply that the cysts were not preserved. These beds accumulated in oxidising environments and are palynologically barren. The land plant mega- and microfossil records suggest that the vegetation of the surrounding hills consisted of mixed deciduous–coniferous forest of a character that is typical of a moist (summer-wet) warm-temperate climate. This is also implied by some of the fauna (e.g., the salmonid fish and the gastropod Bellamya). These observations add significantly to palaeoecological conclusions drawn from the few records of nonmarine dinoflagellate cysts from Cretaceous and younger successions elsewhere, most of which have been associated with quiet lacustrine or lagoonal habitats.},

Disequilibrium element incorporation in garnet due to the development of chemical inhomogeneities around porphyroblasts leads to pronounced episodic growth and may even cause growth interruptions. Discontinuous growth, together with pressure- and temperature-dependent changes in garnet chemistry, cause zonation patterns that are indicative of different degrees of disequilibrium element incorporation. Chemical inhomogeneities in the matrix surrounding garnet porphyroblasts strongly affect garnet growth and lead to compositional discontinuities and steep compositional gradients in the garnet zonation pattern. Further, intergranular diffusion-controlled calcium incorporation can lead to a characteristic rise in grossular and spessartine contents at lower metamorphic conditions. The observation that garnet zonation patterns diagnostic of large and small fractionation effects coexist within the same sample suggests that garnet growth is often controlled by small-scale variations in the bulk rock chemistry. Therefore, the spatial distribution of garnet grains and their zonation patterns, together with numerical growth models of garnet zonation patterns, yield information about the processes limiting garnet growth. These processes include intercrystalline element transport and dissolution of pre-existing grains. Discontinuities in garnet growth induced by limited element supply can mask traces of the thermobarometric history of the rock. Therefore, thermodynamic modelling that considers fractional disequilibrium crystallisation is required to interpret compositional garnet zonation in terms of a quantitative pressure and temperature path of the host rock.},

	abstract = {This PhD thesis investigates the application of heavy minerals in sedimentary provenance analysis, with the main focus on garnet geochemistry. The work is mainly based on an intensive literature study, fieldwork, conventional heavy mineral analysis, electron microprobe analysis of garnet, and statistical data evaluation.  
The thesis is subdivided into six chapters. After an introduction into the subject (Chapter 1), we make an attempt to evaluate six different garnet discrimination diagrams (one binary diagram and five ternary diagrams) commonly used by many researchers (Chapter 2). A large dataset was compiled (N=3532) encompassing major element compositions of garnets derived from various host lithologies, including metamorphic, igneous, and mantle-derived rocks, in order to test the applicability of the various discrimination schemes. The dataset contains mineral chemical data collected from the literature complemented with some new data (N=530) from garnet-bearing metamorphic and ultramafic rocks in Austria and Norway. Discrimination of the tested diagrams only works for a small group of garnets derived from mantle rocks, granulite-facies metasedimentary rocks, and felsic igneous rocks. For other garnet types, the assignment to a certain type of host rock remains ambiguous. We further apply compositional biplot analysis to derive some hints towards future perspectives in detrital garnet discrimination. In Chapter 3, we present results from fieldwork in the southern Tauern window in Austria. Here, we test the application of heavy minerals and garnet geochemistry for sedimentary provenance analysis for modern stream sediments collected along three rivers draining the Eclogite Zone and adjacent geological source units of the western Hohe Tauern area in the central Eastern European Alps. For comparison with the stream sediments, rock outcrops exposed in this area were also sampled. Additionally, the influence of grain-size is studied in detail by considering grain-size fractions ranging from coarse silt to coarse sand (32 to 1000 μm). Interestingly, in all samples, grossular-rich garnets are more frequent in the smaller grain-sizes and pyrope-rich garnets are more frequent in the coarser grain-sizes. This is controlled by the original finer size distribution of grossular in the source rocks rather than being a hydraulic effect. The data underline strong grain-size control on sediment composition including single grain compositional variations. In Chapter 4, we present heavy mineral data and garnet geochemistry of stream sediments and bedrocks from the catchment area draining the Almklovdalen peridotite massif in the Western Gneiss Region in SW Norway. The data reveal that a wider grain-size spectrum than the commonly used grain-size range of 63−125 μm needs to be considered to avoid misleading interpretations. Remarkably is the almost total lack of pyrope-rich garnets in the sediments, which point to the few garnet peridotites exposed in the area. Garnets with pyrope content exceeding 50 \% are only found in the 500−1000 μm grain-size fraction. In Chapter 5, we present heavy mineral and garnet geochemical data of recent stream sediments and bedrocks from three different catchment areas (the Flatraket and Ulvesund body and the island of Runde) in the Western Gneiss Region in SW Norway. We want to test to what extent the heavy minerals and the garnet geochemistry from a single stream-sediment sample per catchment reflect the geological situation in the source area. In overall, the heavy mineral and garnet geochemical data very well reflect the geological situation in the source area, which confirms the application and the importance of heavy minerals in sedimentary provenance analysis. Geochemical data of heavy minerals usually show a wider distribution in the sediments than the data of heavy minerals measured in the bedrocks. However, our results demonstrate that this is not always the case. Some garnets measured in the bedrocks, especially lower grade and ultrahigh-grade metamorphic garnets are only of secondary importance or they are lacking in the sediments. In Chapter 6, we have a look which elements are most useful to discriminate between the several garnet bearing groups. We present first ideas about the compilation of our garnet data and for a step-wise classification of garnets. For this we use the data from our compiled database. At the final end we want to establish a new scheme in which detrital garnets are assigned to a specific rock type with the highest probability. However, this is not yet included in this thesis since we need to work more on that subject.},

The Almklovdalen peridotite massif consists mainly of dunite and harzburgite, as testified by the heavy mineral suite. At the outlet of the main river, the heavy mineral spectrum is very monotonous due to dilution by a strong influx of olivine. Heavy minerals like apatite and epidote characterising the host gneisses have almost disappeared. MgO-rich almandine garnets are more frequent in the coarser grain size fractions, whereas MnO-rich almandine garnets are more frequent in the finer grain size fractions. Garnets with pyrope content exceeding 50\% are only found in the 500–1000μm grain size fraction.

In parallel with the increasing ease of access to data, advanced methods of data interpretation have been developed. The downside of some techniques for visualization and comparison of detrital zircon distribution patterns is that the results are difficult to relate to what the zircon grains really record: The age and nature of geological processes in a protosource terrane. Some simple methods of data presentation and inter-sample comparison that preserve a direct and intuitively understandable relationship between the data and the age of zircon-forming processes in the protosource are proposed here: Comparison of confidence intervals around empirical, cumulative distribution curves combined with the use of a plot of upper vs. lower quartile values of cumulative zircon U-Pb age or Lu-Hf model age distributions. This approach allows a robust and transparent separation to be made between samples whose detrital zircon distributions are indistinguishable from each other, and those that are more or less similar. Furthermore, it allows simple comparison between detrital zircon distributions and the geological age record of potential protosource terranes, or the detrital zircon distributions of possible sedimentary precursors.},

	abstract = {Thick Triassic siliciclastic units form major reservoir targets for hydrocarbon exploration on the Barents Shelf; however, poor reservoir quality, possibly associated with variation in provenance, remains a key risk factor in the area. In this study, sandstone dispersal patterns on the southwest Barents Shelf are investigated through petrographic and heavy mineral analysis, garnet and rutile geochemistry and zircon U-Pb geochronology. The results show that until the Early Norian Maximum Flooding Surface, two contrasting sand types were present: (i) a Caledonian Sand Type, characterised by a high compositional maturity, a heavy mineral assemblage dominated by garnet and low chrome-spinel:zircon (CZi) values, predominantly metapelitic rutiles and mostly Proterozoic and Archaean detrital zircon ages, interpreted to be sourced from the Caledonides, and (ii) a Uralian Sand Type, characterised by a low compositional maturity, high CZi values, predominantly metamafic rutiles and Carboniferous zircon ages, sourced from the Uralian Orogeny. In addition, disparity in detrital zircon ages of the Uralian Sand Type with contiguous strata on the northern Barents Shelf reveals the presence of a Northern Uraloid Sand Type, interpreted to have been sourced from Taimyr and Severnaya Zemlya. As such, a coincidental system is inferred which delivered sand to the Northern Barents Shelf in the late Carnian/early Norian. Following the Early Norian Maximum Flooding Surface, a significant provenance change occurs. In response to Late Triassic/Early Jurassic hinterland rejuvenation, supply from the Uralian Orogen ceased and the northern Scandinavian (Caledonian) source became dominant, extending northwards out on to the southwest Barents Shelf. The data reveal a link between reservoir quality and sand type and illustrate how provenance played an important role in the development of clastic reservoirs within the Triassic of the Barents Shelf.},

	abstract = {During specific intervals within Mesozoic and Cenozoic times, several areas of the southwestern Barents Sea were subjected to uplift and erosion. Areas with missing shallow stratigraphic interval sections and major erosion can be seen at several places along interpreted regional profiles in the southwestern Barents Sea. A new Normal Compaction Trend (NCT) for two selected shale– and sandstone–dominated lithologies has been constructed based on sonic logs in the southwestern Barents Sea. The shale– dominated NCT is calibrated to the Cretaceous shales in the northern North Sea and Norwegian Sea and applied to the Cretaceous shales of the Barents Sea. The sandstone–dominated NCT is calibrated to the Lower Jurassic Åre Formation of the Norwegian Sea and applied to the Lower Jurassic–Upper Triassic coastal plain section in the Barents Sea. By utilising the NCT model, the study estimates net apparent erosion in 28 selected Barents Sea wells based on comparison of sonic log velocities. A net apparent erosion map of the study area was constructed by gridding of the well values. The accuracy of the map is limited in areas with little well control, such as in the northwest, where the east–west transition into the southwestern Barents Sea region is poorly constrained. With that in mind, the map clearly shows two regional trends which dominate the erosion pattern in the study area; an increasing amount of erosion towards the north and a sharp decrease of erosion westwards of the hinge zone into the southwestern Barents Sea. The highest erosion estimates are observed towards Svalbard, with values up to 2500 m. The results of this study can be further utilized in petroleum system studies in the eroded areas.},

	abstract = {Notwithstanding the numerous contributions that have been published on theoretical and practical aspects of the management of compositional (constrained) data during the last thirty years, in geochemistry most of the scientific papers in international journals continue to ignore their peculiar features. In order to understand the reasons of the undervaluation of the effects of an incorrect choice of the sample space and, consequently, an incorrect application of the distance concept, case studies of comparison between methodologies will be presented and discussed. The aim is to evaluate the differences in interpretation of geochemical processes affecting rocks, water and gaseous samples, when the two different approaches, classical and compositional, are adopted. If we compare the results of case studies following the two paths it is possible to evaluate which type of error (and consequences) will affect our evaluations in geochemistry. The presence of expected differences between the two approaches indicates that compositional data analysis can be a way to see beyond the illusion due to the constrained space. However, the possibility that the difference is tenuous in some situations, not revealed a priori, may be at the origin of the unconscious choice of the classical approach. Is this condition which some researchers call “common sense” frequently encountered in geochemistry? The paper is aimed to try to answer the proposed question, and to understand the difficulty of diffusion of compositional data analysis even if now simple tools of investigation, for different degrees of knowledge, are available.},

The treatment of lake sediment geochemical data within the compositional framework of logratio analysis and the corresponding use of principal component analysis, analysis of variance, linear discriminant analysis and spatial analysis with ordinary kriging provide an informative and quantitative manner for lithologic mapping. Principal component analysis provides useful information on the multi-element associations based on the contrast of rock types in the area. Supracrustal sedimentary rocks have a multi-element character that is distinctive from rocks derived from granitoid and gneissic rocks. The analysis of variance provides details on which elements are the best discriminators for differentiating between the rock types represented by the lake sediment geochemistry and the spatial analysis provides insight into the direction and spatial continuity of the elements associated with specific map units. Linear discriminant analysis provides a basis for distinguishing between the different map units and provides a method of validating the predictive capability of mapping the underlying map units based on the lake sediment geochemistry. The application of multivariate statistical methods on lake sediment geochemical data provides the basis for establishing an objective approach for discovering and classifying geochemical processes from which existing geological maps can be tested and validated and new geological maps can be made in areas where sufficient geological information is lacking.},

	abstract = {Coal is a chemically complex commodity that often contains most of the natural elements in the periodic table. Coal constituents are conventionally grouped into four components (proximate analysis): fixed carbon, ash, inherent moisture, and volatile matter. These four parts, customarily measured as weight losses and expressed as percentages, share all properties and statistical challenges of compositional data. Consequently, adequate modeling should be done in terms of a logratio transformation, a requirement that is commonly overlooked by modelers. The transformation of choice is the isometric logratio transformation because of its geometrical and statistical advantages. The modeling is done through a series of realizations prepared by applying sequential simulation for the purpose of displaying the parts in maps incorporating uncertainty. The approach makes realistic assumptions and the results honor the data and basic considerations, such as percentages between 0 and 100, all four parts adding to 100\% at any location in the study area, and a style of spatial fluctuation in the realizations equal to that of the data. The realizations are used to prepare different results, including probability distributions across a deposit, E-type maps displaying average properties, and probability maps summarizing joint fluctuations of several parts. Application of these maps to a lignite bed clearly delineates the deposit boundary, reveals a channel cutting across, and shows that the most favorable coal quality is to the north and deteriorates toward the southeast.},

The data were originally published as part of an industry report. The analysis was adapted to consider the compositional nature of the data and avoid potentially spurious correlations present in raw concentration data through the application of log-ratio transformations. Techniques such as robust variation arrays, robust principal component analysis, and relative variation plots were applied to log-ratio transformed data. Results from this battery of multivariate tools indicate that two primary processes affect the chemical evolution of the water returned to the surface during the first 90days of production: mixing of injected water with formation brines of evaporated paleoseawater origin and injection of sulfate-rich water during hydraulic fracturing may stimulate sulfate reduction at some sites. Spatial variability in sulfate/alkalinity ratios appears to influence variations in geochemical controls on strontium versus barium with elevated proportions of strontium being found in more bicarbonate-poor environments, while barium is a larger proportion in sulfate-poor areas. Comparison of results using a log-ratio approach versus the more common analysis of concentration data reveals both similarities and some marked differences in the resulting interpretations. Results from this work are important in terms of both demonstrating methods to avoid mathematical inconsistencies from using raw brine geochemical data and to further investigate the geochemical controls on produced waters generated from shale gas reservoirs.},

This paper demonstrates, using the Na–Cl–Br system, that these mathematical problems are exacerbated in the study of sedimentary basin brines by such processes as the evaporation or dissolution of salts owing to their high salinities. Using two published datasets of Na–Cl–Br data for fluids from the Appalachian Basin, it is shown that log concentration and Na/Br versus Cl/Br methods for displaying solute chemistry may lead to misinterpretation of mixing trends between meteoric waters (for example shallow drinking water aquifers) and basinal brines, partially due to spurious mathematical relationships. An alternative approach, based on the isometric log-ratio transformation of molar concentration data, is developed and presented as an alternative method, free from potential numerical problems of the traditional methods. The utility, intuitiveness, and potential for mathematical problems of the three methods are compared and contrasted. Because the Na–Cl–Br system is a useful tool for sourcing solutes and investigating the evolution of basinal brines, results from this research may impact such critical topics as evaluating sources of brine contamination in the environment (possibly related to oil and gas production), evaluating the behavior of fluids in the reservoir during hydraulic fracturing, and tracking movement of fluids as a result of geologic CO2 sequestration.},

	abstract = {This study discusses the laws which govern sediment deposition, and consequently determine size-dependent compositional variability. A theoretical approach is substantiated by robust datasets on major Alpine, Himalayan, and African sedimentary systems. Integrated (bulk-petrography, heavy-mineral, X-ray powder diffraction) multiple-window analyses at 0.25ϕ to 0.50ϕ sieve interval of eighty-five fluvial, beach, and eolian-dune samples, ranging from very fine silt to coarse sand, document homologous intrasample compositional trends, revealed by systematic concentration of denser grains in finer-grained fractions (“size–density sorting”). These trends are explained by the settling-equivalence principle, stating that detrital minerals are deposited together if their settling velocity is the same. Settling of silt is chiefly resisted by fluid viscosity, and Stokes' law predicts that size differences between detrital minerals in ϕ units (“size shifts”) are half the difference between the logarithms of their submerged densities. Settling of pebbles is chiefly resisted by turbulence effects, and the Impact law predicts double size shifts than Stokes' law. Settling of sand is resisted by both viscosity and turbulence, the settling-equivalence formula is complex, and size shifts increase – with increasing settling velocity and grain size – from those predicted by Stokes' law to those predicted by the Impact law. In wind-laid sands, size shifts match those predicted by the Impact law; size–density sorting is thus greater than in water-laid fine sands. New analytical, graphical, and statistical techniques for rigorous settling-equivalence analysis of terrigenous sediments are illustrated. Deviations associated with non-spherical shape, density anomalies, inheritance from source rocks, or mixing of detrital species with contrasting provenance and different size distribution are also tentatively assessed. Such integrated theoretical and experimental approach allows us to mathematically predict intrasample compositional variability of water-laid and wind-laid sediments, once the density of detrital components is known.},

	abstract = {Diagenetic processes that alter the depositional composition of sands must be considered when making provenance interpretations. These modifying processes operate from the zone of weathering to the deep subsurface where diagenesis grades into metamorphism. Of greatest importance is the total dissolution of grains of feldspar, rock fragments, and heavy minerals by corrosive meteoric or subsurface waters to severely modify original sand composition. Some “diagenetic quartzarenites” have been produced by essentially wholesale dissolution of non-quartz grains under severe weathering. Even partial dissolution of some rock fragments can alter them beyond identification. Of great importance also is the replace­ment of detrital grains by authigenic carbonates, clays, zeolites, and many other minerals. Although the identity of pseudomorphous grains of distinctive size and shape can logically be deduced for some sandstones, the identity of most totally replaced grains cannot be determined with confidence. The albitization of plagioclase more calcic than An10 and of K-feldspar should be expected for all deeply buried sandstones. In the Texas Gulf Coast basin, albitization is important for sandstones that reach burial temperatures in excess of 120° C.There are several additional processes that can complicate provenance determinations. In environments where detrital ferromagnesian minerals, magnetite and rutile are undergoing oxidation to produce the pigment of secondary red beds, hematite, and its precursors can invade micropores in rock fragments sufficiently to prevent their identification. Of lesser importance, but locally troublesome, is the loss of primary textures of carbonate and other rock fragments that undergo recrystallization or severe compaction.},

	abstract = {Geochemical data are commonly censored, that is, concentrations for some samples are reported as “less than” or “greater than” some value. Censored data hampers statistical analysis because certain computational techniques used in statistical analysis require a complete set of uncensored data. We show that the simple substitution method for creating an uncensored dataset, e.g., replacement by3/4 times the detection limit, has serious flaws, and we present an objective method to determine the replacement value. Our basic premise is that the replacement value should equal the mean of the actual values represented by the qualified data. We adapt the maximum likelihood approach (Cohen, 1961) to estimate this mean. This method reproduces the mean and skewness as well or better than a simple substitution method using3/4 of the lower detection limit or3/4 of the upper detection limit. For a small proportion of “less than” substitutions, a simple-substitution replacement factor of 0.55 is preferable to3/4; for a small proportion of “greater than” substitutions, a simple-substitution replacement factor of 1.7 is preferable to4/3, provided the resulting replacement value does not exceed 100\%. For more than 10\% replacement, a mean empirical factor may be used. However, empirically determined simple-substitution replacement factors usually vary among different data sets and are less reliable with more replacements. Therefore, a maximum likelihood method is superior in general. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that true replacement factors for “less thans” decrease in magnitude with more replacements and larger standard deviation; those for “greater thans” increase in magnitude with more replacements and larger standard deviation. In contrast to any simple substitution method, the maximum likelihood method reproduces these variations. Using the maximum likelihood method for replacing “less thans” in our sample data set, correlation coefficients were reasonably accurately estimated in 90\% of the cases for as much as 40\% replacement and in 60\% of the cases for 80\% replacement. These results suggest that censored data can be utilized more than is commonly realized.},

	abstract = {Provenance analysis of sediments is aimed at reconstructing the parent-rock assemblages of sediments and the climatic-physiographic conditions under which sediments formed. Inferring sediment provenance from the final product, a basin fill, is anything but straightforward because the detrital spectrum evolves as the sediment is transported along the pathway from source to basin. Successful provenance analysis requires that the nature and extent of compositional and textural modifications to the detrital spectrum be recognised, if not quantified. The history of quantification in sediment-provenance studies is summarised and illustrated by tracking two fundamental ideas: the concept of the sediment-petrological province or petrofacies, and the relation between sandstone composition and (plate) tectonic environment. Progress in sedimentary provenance analysis has been closely linked with advancements in measurement technology. A brief survey of modern data-acquisition tools illustrates the possibilities and limitations of modern provenance research. An operational definition of Quantitative Provenance Analysis (QPA) is presented in which the central role of mass balance is acknowledged. Extension of this definition to include quantitative predictions obtained by forward modelling (computer simulation) of sediment production, as well as methodological improvements in data acquisition and processing is needed to cover likely future developments in QPA. The contributions to the special issue "Quantitative Provenance Analysis of Sediments" illustrate the intrinsic multidisciplinarity and rapid expansion of QPA.},

It was shown to be a non-linear operation in the simplex that does not preserve distances under perturbation. The discussion motivated the introduction in the present paper of concepts such as group of parts, balance between groups, and sequential binary partition, which are intended to provide tools of compositional data analysis for dimension reduction. Key concepts underlying this development are the established tools of subcomposition, coordinates in an orthogonal basis of the simplex, balancing element and, in general, the Aitchison geometry in the simplex. Main new results are: a method to analyze grouped parts of a compositional vector through the adequate coordinates in an ad hoc orthonormal basis; and the study of balances of groups of parts (inter-group analysis) as an orthogonal projection similar to that used in standard subcompositional analysis (intra-group analysis). A simulated example compares results when testing equal centers of two populations using amalgamated parts and balances; it shows that, in certain circumstances, results from both analysis can disagree.},

The main goal was to develop analytical tools for the statistical analysis of compositional data. Our present aim is to get a further insight into some aspects of this geometry in order to clarify the way for more complex statistical approaches. This is done by way of orthonormal bases, which allow for a straightforward handling of geometric elements in the simplex. The transformation into real coordinates preserves all metric properties and is thus called isometric logratio transformation (ilr). An important result is the decomposition of the simplex, as a vector space, into orthogonal subspaces associated with nonoverlapping subcompositions. This gives the key to join compositions with different parts into a single composition by using a balancing element. The relationship between ilr transformations and the centered-logratio (clr) and additive-logratio (alr) transformations is also studied. Exponential growth or decay of mass is used to illustrate compositional linear processes, parallelism and orthogonality in the simplex.},

In addition the biplots are also introduced as a powerful tool to analyse and discover special features related to subcompositions. The exploratory methodology is applied to a dataset consisting of the major, minor and trace elements composition of soil samples from several places in Tuscany (Italy). The structure of the data, collected from three different known country rocks of ophiolitic nature (basic and ultrabasic rocks), represent an interesting case study for experimenting on new methodologies of statistical investigation and for pointing out differences related to parental chemistry and mineralogy as well as the nature of processes to be related to the subsequent evolution.},

Sediment provenance and source-specific accumulation rates of surface sediments were quantified by combining results of grain-size analysis and geochemical analysis of specific size fractions with bulk mass accumulation rates. Statistical classification algorithms adapted to compositional data were used to partition the total (geochemical) variation of sediment properties into size-related and provenance-specific factors. We identified geochemically distinct fluvial end-member sediment types in two different grain-size fractions, which were grouped into sediments derived from the Apennine rivers, and sediments derived from the Po and Adige rivers. Compositional fingerprints (end-member compositions) of each source area were estimated by taking into account relative rates of fluvial sediment supply from rivers as predicted by numerical modelling. The end members allow us to explain geochemical compositional variation of mud-wedge surface sediments in terms of provenance and size-selective dispersal, and map mass accumulation rates of sediments from individual source areas (grain size{\textless}63 μm), as well as bulk sand accumulation rates (grain size{\textgreater}63 μm) across the western Adriatic mud wedge. The source-specific rates of fine-grained sediment supply derived from geostatistical estimates of mass-accumulation rates were used to calibrate the numerical model of sediment supply to present-day conditions.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for assessing and statistically testing the similarity of detrital zircon U–Pb age distributions frequently used in provenance analysis, correlation and tectonic reconstructions. The method accounts for intrinsic measurement uncertainties by constructing kernel functional estimates of each set of age data that compensate for different degrees of measurement error by the application of varying levels of smoothing. The dissimilarity between these estimates can be quantified and provides a meaningful comparison between age distributions. A Monte Carlo permutation algorithm is used to test for equality between age distributions by grouping two sets of age data and then resampling the age distributions. The techniques are demonstrated with both synthetic and real data. Synthetic data illustrate the behaviour of the algorithms with data containing varying age modes and measurement uncertainties. Real data from Tasmania and southeastern Australia illustrates both the broad correlation with previous similarity assessment techniques and the applicability of the described methods to provenance, regional correlation and tectonic reconstruction.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that Cenozoic epeirogeny of the African continent is moderated by convective circulation of the mantle. Nevertheless, the spatial and temporal evolution of Africa's “basin-and-swell” physiography is not well known. Here we show how continental drainage networks can be used to place broad constraints on the pattern of uplift through space and time. First, we assemble an inventory of 710 longitudinal river profiles that includes major tributaries of the 10 largest catchments. River profiles have been jointly inverted to determine the pattern of uplift rate as a function of space and time. Our inverse model assumes that shapes of river profiles are controlled by uplift rate history and modulated by erosional processes, which can be calibrated using independent geologic evidence (e.g., marine terraces, volcanism and thermochronologic data). Our results suggest that modern African topography started to develop ∼30 Myr ago when volcanic swells appeared in North and East Africa. During the last 15–20 Myr, subequatorial Africa was rapidly elevated, culminating in the appearance of three large swells that straddle southern and western coasts. Our results enable patterns of sedimentary flux at major deltas to be predicted and tested. We suggest that the evolution of drainage networks is dominated by rapid upstream advection of signals produced by a changing pattern of regional uplift. An important corollary is that, with careful independent calibration, these networks might act as useful tape recorders of otherwise inaccessible mantle processes. Finally, we note that there are substantial discrepancies between our results and published dynamic topographic predictions.},

Most of the samples are from the GEOSECS expeditions which covered the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans between 1971 and 1978. The results from 2252 samples from 107 hydrographic stations are presented as north-south vertical (depth) sections with δ13C contoured at intervals of 0.1\%. The data show that the distribution of δ13C is controlled mainly by the input of organically produced material and its subsequent oxidation as it falls through the water column. This covariance can be summarized by the regression equation: δ13C=1.5−0.0075·AOU, where AOU represents the oxygen utilization within a water sample after leaving the surface. Other factors influencing the distribution of δ13C are the dissolution of inorganic carbonate and the addition of anthropogenic CO2 to the oceans. A complex mathematical model was employed to estimate the levels of ΣCO2 and δ13C in pre-industrial oceanic surface waters. The results suggest that the ΣCO2 of surface waters has increased by 40 μmole kg−1 from a pre-industrial level of approximately 2135 μmole kg−1. The δ13C of the ΣCO2 has decreased by 0.5\% from a pre-industrial value of approximately 2.5\%.},

The CIE, which are recorded mainly in marine sedimentary sequences, have also been identified in continental sequences, occurred episodically, and yet appear to be paced or triggered by orbital forcing. To constrain the timing and scale of the CIE relative to long-term baseline variability, we have constructed a 4.52 million year (myr) long, high-resolution ({\textasciitilde} 3 kyr) bulk sediment carbon isotope record spanning the lower Eocene to upper Paleocene (C25r–C24n) from a pelagic sediment section recovered at ODP Site 1262 in the southeast Atlantic. This section, which was orbitally-tuned utilizing high-resolution core log physical property and geochemical records, is the most stratigraphically complete upper Paleocene to lower Eocene sequence recovered to date. Time-series analysis of the carbon isotope record along with a high-resolution Fe intensity record obtained by XRF core scanner reveal cyclicity with variance concentrated primarily in the precession (21 kyr) and eccentricity bands (100 and 400-kyr) throughout the upper Paleocene–lower Eocene. In general, minima in δ13C correspond with peaks in Fe (i.e., carbonate dissolution), both of which appear to be in phase with maxima in eccentricity. This covariance is consistent with excess oceanic uptake of isotopically depleted carbon resulting in lower carbonate saturation during periods of high eccentricity. This relationship includes all late Paleocene and early Eocene CIE confirming pacing by orbital forcing. The lone exception is the PETM, which appears to be out of phase with the 400-kyr cycle, though possibly in phase with the 100-kyr cycle, reinforcing the notion that a mechanism other than orbital forcing and/or an additional source of carbon is required to account for the occurrence and unusual scale of this event.},

	abstract = {The Early Eocene Climate Optimum (EECO, which occurred about 51 to 53 million years ago), was the warmest interval of the past 65 million years, with mean annual surface air temperature over ten degrees Celsius warmer than during the pre-industrial period. Subsequent global cooling in the middle and late Eocene epoch, especially at high latitudes, eventually led to continental ice sheet development in Antarctica in the early Oligocene epoch (about 33.6 million years ago). However, existing estimates place atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during the Eocene at 500–3,000 parts per million, and in the absence of tighter constraints carbon–climate interactions over this interval remain uncertain. Here we use recent analytical and methodological developments to generate a new high-fidelity record of CO2 concentrations using the boron isotope (δ11B) composition of well preserved planktonic foraminifera from the Tanzania Drilling Project, revising previous estimates. Although species-level uncertainties make absolute values difficult to constrain, CO2 concentrations during the EECO were around 1,400 parts per million. The relative decline in CO2 concentration through the Eocene is more robustly constrained at about fifty per cent, with a further decline into the Oligocene. Provided the latitudinal dependency of sea surface temperature change for a given climate forcing in the Eocene was similar to that of the late Quaternary period, this CO2 decline was sufficient to drive the well documented high- and low-latitude cooling that occurred through the Eocene. Once the change in global temperature between the pre-industrial period and the Eocene caused by the action of all known slow feedbacks (apart from those associated with the carbon cycle) is removed, both the EECO and the late Eocene exhibit an equilibrium climate sensitivity relative to the pre-industrial period of 2.1 to 4.6 degrees Celsius per CO2 doubling (66 per cent confidence), which is similar to the canonical range (1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius), indicating that a large fraction of the warmth of the early Eocene greenhouse was driven by increased CO2 concentrations, and that climate sensitivity was relatively constant throughout this period.},

	abstract = {We have used a diffusion-advection-reaction model for Sr exchange during deep-sea carbonate diagenesis to determine the rate and consequences of Sr exchange between porewaters and bulk carbonate at six DSDP sites (590B, 575, 593, 516, 305 and 289) where the required Sr concentration and isotopic composition data for the interstitial waters are available from the literature. The model can reproduce both the Sr2+ and 87Sr/86Sr profiles in the porewaters at each of the sites by adjusting the rate of Sr exchange due to solution-reprecipitation as a function of sediment age. We find that the rate of solution-reprecipitation at all of the sites is highest for the youngest sediment (1–10\%/m.y.) and decreases by about an order of magnitude over the first 10 m.y. of sediment age. The effect of this exchange on the properties of the bulk carbonate is to reduce the Sr content by 5–25\%, depending primarily on the sedimentation rate, and shift the 87Sr/86Sr by as much as 0.00004 from the value the sediment had when first deposited. Isotopic shifts of this magnitude are large compared to present analytical uncertainties and therefore should be corrected for when using bulk carbonate 87Sr/86Sr for stratigraphic correlation. The average Sr loss in the carbonate sections studied is about 15\%, from which we conclude that the Sr flux from carbonate sediments to the overlying ocean is of the order of 15\% of the riverine Sr flux. We also show that the isotopic composition of the diagenetic Sr flux is at all times quite close to the contemporaneous seawater value and therefore this flux plays a very minor role in the overall Sr budget that determines the Sr isotopic composition of seawater. The range of Sr losses from bulk carbonate due to diagenesis that we calculate is too small to account for the typical decrease in Sr content seen in pelagic carbonates as a function of age (about 70\% over the first 100 m.y.). We conclude that this decrease is not the result of diagenesis and must involve some changing property of the ocean itself.},

	abstract = {A numerical model is presented for the transport and exchange of oxygen isotopes in an idealized two-layer oceanic crust (basalt-carbonate) that is saturated with a non-advecting pore fluid open to the overlying ocean. The model allows for time-varying sedimentation rate, porosity, chemical diffusivity, and temperature-dependent 18O fractionation factors. Reaction is modeled as solution-precipitation of calcite in the carbonate sediment and as modified solution-precipitation (basalt dissolves, smectite precipitates) in the basalt layer. Generic models, using input parameters that are typical of those measured in DSDP-ODP cores, and constant sedimentation rates, illustrate the behavior of the system sufficiently well to allow first-order effects to be discerned that have important implications for paleotemperature and ocean floor weathering studies. The solution-precipitation reactions allow oxygen to be exchanged between the low-δ18O basalt layer and the high-δ18O carbonate sediment through the medium of the pore fluids. This results in δ18O increasing upwards in the basalt and decreasing downwards in the sediment. Pore fluid δ18O values decrease with depth from zero to values of −1 to −3‰ at the basalt-sediment interface, and to values of −7 to −15‰ within the basalt. Because reaction rates are slow relative to diffusion in the pore fluid, high-frequency δ18O variations in the solid are preserved indefinitely, but the amplitude of the variations decreases as e−Rt where R is the reaction rate (fraction reacted per unit time). The results suggest that the diagenetic shifts of the δ18O values of benthic and high-latitude planktonic foraminifera samples younger than Oligocene age are typically negligible. For samples older than 50 Ma, diagenetic effects are typically significant, and generally cause estimates of bottom and high-latitude surface ocean temperatures in the Cretaceous and early Tertiary to be too high. On the other hand, the model suggests that diagenesis will shift the δ18O values of low-latitude planktonic foraminifera to higher values, and that paleotemperature estimates of low-latitude surface waters, particularly in the Eocene and Oligocene, may be too low. Using a synthetic δ18O record for DSDP Site 167, we demonstrate how numerical models can be used to correct specific measured records for diagenesis. This approach could provide a means of extracting paleotemperature information from heavily altered Late Cretaceous and older samples, and for quantifying the subtle effects of diagenesis on the δ18O record at all sites.},

	abstract = {Glassy Turonian foraminifera preserved in clay-rich sediments from the western tropical Atlantic yield the warmest equivalent δ18O sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) yet reported for the entire Cretaceous-Cenozoic. We estimate Turonian SSTs that were at least as warm as (conservative mean ∼30 °C) to significantly warmer (warm mean ∼33 °C) than those in the region today. However, if independent evidence for high middle Cretaceous pCO2 is reliable and resulted in greater isotopic fractionation between seawater and calcite because of lower sea-surface pH, our conservative and warm SST estimates would be even higher (32 and 36 °C, respectively). Our new tropical SSTs help reconcile geologic data with the predictions of general circulation models that incorporate high Cretaceous pCO2 and lend support to the hypothesis of a Cretaceous greenhouse. Our data also strengthen the case for a Turonian age for the Cretaceous thermal maximum and highlight a 20–40 m.y. mismatch between peak Cretaceous-Cenozoic global warmth and peak inferred tectonic CO2 production. We infer that this mismatch is either an artifact of a hidden Turonian pulse in global ocean-crust cycling or real evidence of the influence of some other factor on atmospheric CO2 and/or SSTs. A hidden pulse in crust cycling would explain the timing of peak Cretaceous-Cenozoic sea level (also Turonian), but other factors are needed to explain high-frequency (∼10–100 k.y.) instability in middle Cretaceous SSTs reported elsewhere.},

	abstract = {A numerical model which describes oxygen isotope exchange during burial and recrystallization of deep-sea carbonate is used to obtain information on how sea surface temperatures have varied in the past by correcting measured δ18O values of bulk carbonate for diagenetic overprinting. Comparison of bulk carbonate and planktonic foraminiferal δ18O records from ODP site 677A indicates that the oxygen isotopic composition of bulk carbonate does reflect changes in sea surface temperature and δ18O. At ODP Site 690, we calculate that diagenetic effects are small, and that both bulk carbonate and planktonic foraminiferal δ18O records accurately reflect Paleogene warming of high latitude surface oceans, biased from diagenesis by no more than 1°C. The same is likely to be true for other high latitude sites where sedimentation rates are low. At DSDP sites 516 and 525, the effects of diagenesis are more significant. Measured δ18O values of Eocene bulk carbonates are more than 2\% lower at deeply buried site 516 than at site 525, consistent with the model prediction that the effects of diagenesis should be proportional to sedimentation rate. Model-corrections reconcile the differences in the data between the two sites; the resulting paleotemperature reconstruction indicates a 4°C cooling of mid-latitude surface oceans since the Eocene. At low latitudes, the contrast in temperature between the ocean surface and bottom makes the carbonate δ180 values particularly sensitive to diagenetic effects; most of the observed variations in measured δ18O values are accounted for by diagenetic effects rather than by sea surface temperature variations. We show that the data are consistent with constant equatorial sea surface temperatures through most of the Cenozoic, with the possible exception of the early Eocene, when slightly higher temperatures are indicated. We suggest that the lower equatorial sea surface temperatures for the Eocene and Oligocene reported in other oxygen isotope studies are artifacts of diagenetic recrystallization, and that it is impossible to reconstruct accurately equatorial sea surface temperatures without explicitly accounting for diagenetic overprinting.},

Foraminifera and other organisms can potentially preserve their original isotope ratio for many millions of years, although diagenetic processes can 
alter the ratios. Work on oxygen isotope ratios of foraminifera was instrumental in the discovery of the 
orbital theory of the ice ages and continues to be widely used in the study of rapid climate change. Compilations of deep sea benthic foraminifer oxygen isotopes have revealed the long history of global climate 
change over the past 100 million years. Planktonic foraminifer oxygen isotopes are used to investigate the 
history of past sea surface temperatures, revealing the extent of past 'greenhouse' warming and global sea 
surface temperatures.},

Palynofacies analysis involves the identification of individual palynomorph, plant debris, and amorphous components, their absolute and relative proportions, size spectra, and preservation states (Combaz 1964, 1980). Palynomorph colour estimation of the level of organic maturation was also included in the original concept, although this is now usually regarded as a somewhat separate and distinct field of study.},

	abstract = {Carbonate rocks and natural waters exhibit a wide range in the concentration and isotopic composition of strontium. This wide range and the quantifiable covariation of these parameters can provide diagnostic tools for understanding processes of fluid-rock interaction. Careful consideration of the uncertainties associated with trace element partitioning, sample heterogeneity and fluid-rock interaction mechanisms is required to advance the application of the trace element and isotope geochemistry of strontium to studies of diagenesis, goundwater evolution, ancient seawater chemistry and isotope stratigraphy. A principal uncertainty involved in the application of Sr concentration variations to carbonate systems is the large range of experimental and empirical results for trace element partitioning of Sr between mineral and solution. This variation may be a function of precipitation rate, mineral stoichiometry, crystal growth mechanism, fluid composition and temperature. Calcite and dolomite in ancient limestones commonly have significantly lower Sr concentrations (20–70 p.p.m.) than would be expected from published trace element distribution coefficient values and Sr/Ca ratios of most modern sedimentary pore waters. This discrepancy probably reflects the uncertainties associated with determining distribution coefficient values. As techniques improve for the analytical measurement and theoretical modelling of Sr concentration and isotopic variations, the petrological analysis of carbonate samples becomes increasingly important. The presence of even small percentages of non-carbonate phases with high Rb concentrations and high 87 Sr86 Sr values, such as clay minerals, can have significant effects on the measured 87 Sr/86 Sr values of carbonate rocks, due to the decay of 87Rb to 87 Sr. For example, a Permian marine limestone with 50 p.p.m. Sr and 1 p.p.m. Rb will have a present-day 87 Sr/86 Sr value that is {\textgreater}2 × 10−4 higher than its original value. This difference is an order of magnitude greater than the analytical uncertainty, and illustrates the importance of assessing the need for and accuracy of such corrections. A quantitative evaluation of the effects of water-rock interaction on Sr concentrations and isotope compositions in carbonates strengthens the application of these geochemical tracers. Geochemical modelling that combines the use of trace elements and isotopes can be used to distinguish between different mechanisms of water-rock interaction, including diffusive and advective transport of diagenetic constituents in meteoric pore fluids during the recrystallization of carbonate minerals. Quantitative modelling may also be used to construct diagnostic fluid-rock interaction trends that are independent of distribution coefficient values, and to distinguish between mixing of mineral end-members and fluid-rock interaction.},

Such applications of CL have great potential for applied research, e.g., via establishing porosity evolution in hydrocarbon reservoirs (e.g., several articles in Barker and Kopp 1991). Another popular use of CL is to identify marine components (cements or biochems, mainly brachiopods) that are unaltered or least altered by recrystallization, in order to determine the isotopic composition of paleo-ocean water (e.g., Popp et al. 1986; Lohmann and Walker 1989; Tobin et al. 1996).},

	abstract = {Marked negative δ13C excursions in Ediacaran-age carbonate sediments have been identified in several sections globally, but are not recognized in all sections of similar age. The presence of δ13Ccarb values as low as −12‰ has been interpreted as recording fundamentally different processes in the global carbon cycle than those recognized today. The δ13Ccarb anomalies are strongly correlated with δ18Ocarb values but are not represented in δ13Corg records. While no primary depositional processes have been identified that can produce the correlated δ18O–δ13C arrays, simulations show that fluid–rock interaction with high-pCO2 fluids is capable of producing such arrays at geologically reasonable pCO2 and water–rock ratios. Variations in the Mg/Ca ratio and sulfate concentration of the altering fluid determine the extent of dolomite vs. calcite and anhydrite in the resulting mineral assemblage. Incorporation of an initially aragonitic mineralogy demonstrates that high Sr, low Mn/Sr and modest alteration of 87Sr/86Sr in ancient carbonates are all compatible with a burial diagenesis mechanism for generation of the δ13C anomalies, and do not necessarily imply preservation of primary values. The profound Ediacaran negative δ13C anomalies can be adequately explained by well-understood diagenetic processes, conflated with the difficulty of correlating Precambrian sections independently of chemostratigraphy. They are not a record of primary seawater variations and need not have independent stratigraphic significance.},

	abstract = {Septarian carbonate concretions contain carbonate precipitated during progressive growth of the concretion and subsequent fracture-filling. As such, they have been used to track variations in δ13C and δ18O of pore waters during diagenesis and to define diagenetic zones in clastic rocks. However, the δ18O value of the carbonate is dependent on precipitation temperature and the δ18O value of the pore fluid from which it precipitated. Interpretations must assume one of these parameters, both of which are highly variable through time in diagenetic settings. Carbonate clumped isotopes of the cement can provide independent estimates of temperature of precipitation, allowing the pore-water δ18O to be back-calculated. Here, we use this technique on carbonate concretions and fracture fills of the Upper Cretaceous Prairie Canyon Member, Mancos Shale, Colorado. We sampled concretions from two permeable horizons separated by a 5 m shale layer, with one permeable horizon containing concretions with septarian fractures. We show cores precipitated at cooler temperatures (31 °C, ∼660 m burial depth) than the rims (68 °C (∼1980 m burial depth) and relate that to the δ13Ccarbonate values to suggest the concretion core precipitated in the methanogenic zone, with increasing input from thermogenically produced CO2. The two concretion-bearing horizons have different back-calculated δ18Oporewater values (mean − 2.65 ‰ and 1.13‰ VSMOW) for cements formed at the same temperature and similar δ13C values, suggesting the shale layer present between the two horizons acted as a barrier to fluid mixing. Additionally, the δ18Ocarbonate of the septarian fractures ( − 13.8 ‰ VPBD) are due to precipitation at high temperatures (102 to 115 °C) from a fluid with a mean δ18Oporewater of 0.32‰ (VSMOW). Therefore, we can tie in the cementation history of the formation to temporal and spatial variations in δ18Oporewater.},

	abstract = {Clumped isotope compositions of slowly-cooled calcite and dolomite marbles record apparent equilibrium temperatures of roughly 150-200 °C and 300-350 °C, respectively. Because clumped isotope compositions are sensitive to the details of T-t path within these intervals, measurements of the Δ\_(47) values of coexisting calcite and dolomite can place new constraints on thermal history of low-grade metamorphic rocks over a large portion of the upper crust (from ∼5 to ∼15 km depth). We studied the clumped isotope geochemistry of coexisting calcite and dolomite in marbles from the Notch Peak contact metamorphic aureole, Utah. Here, flat-lying limestones were intruded by a pluton, producing a regular, zoned metamorphic aureole. Calcite Δ\_(47) temperatures are uniform, 156 ± 12 ˚C (2σ s.e.), across rocks varying from high-grade marbles that exceeded 500 °C to nominally unmetamorphosed limestones {\textgreater}5 km from the intrusion. This result appears to require that the temperature far from the pluton was close to this value; an ambient temperature just 20 ˚C lower would not have permitted substantial re-equilibration, and should have preserved depositional or early diagenetic Δ\_(47) values several km from the pluton. Combining this result with depth constraints from overlying strata suggests the country rock here had an average regional geotherm of 22.3–27.4 ˚C/km from the late Jurassic Period until at least the middle Paleogene Period. Dolomite Δ\_(47) in all samples above the talc+tremolite-in isograd record apparent equilibrium temperatures of 328{\textasciicircum}(+13)\_(-12) °C (1σ s.e.), consistent with the apparent equilibrium blocking temperature we expect for cooling from peak metamorphic conditions. At greater distances, dolomite Δ\_(47) records temperatures of peak (anchi)metamorphism or pre-metamorphic diagenetic conditions. The interface between these domains is the location of the 330 ˚C isotherm associated with intrusion. Multiple-phase clumped isotope measurements are complemented by bulk δ{\textasciicircum}(13)C and δ{\textasciicircum}(18)O dolomite-calcite thermometry. These isotopic exchange thermometers are largely consistent with peak temperatures in all samples within 4 km of the contact, indicating that metamorphic recrystallization can occur even in samples too low-grade to produce growth of conventional metamorphic index minerals (i.e., talc and tremolite).

	abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is based on the temperature-dependent formation of 13C18O16O22− ion groups within the lattice of solid carbonate minerals. At low temperatures the bonds between rare, heavy 13C and 18O isotopes are thermodynamically favored, and thus at equilibrium they are present in higher than random abundances. Here we calibrate the use of this temperature proxy in a previously uncalibrated carbonate phase — dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2] — over a temperature range that extends to conditions typical of shallow crustal environments, by determining the Δ47 values of CO2 extracted from synthetic or natural (proto)dolomites grown at known temperatures from 25 to 350 °C and analyzed in two different laboratories using different procedures for sample analysis, purification and post-measurement data treatment. We found that the Δ47-1/T2 dependence for (proto)dolomite is linear between 25 and 350 °C, independent of their Mg/Ca compositions or cation order (or the laboratory in which they were analyzed), and offset from, but parallel to, the theoretical predictions of the Δ63 dependence to temperature of the abundance of the 13C18O16O2 isotopologue inside the dolomite and calcite mineral lattices as expected from ab-initio calculations (Schauble et al., 2006). This suggests that neither the equilibrium constant for 13C–18O clumping in (proto)dolomite lattice, nor the experimental fractionation associated with acid digestion to produce CO2, depend on their formation mechanism, degree of cation order and/or stoichiometry (i.e., Mg/Ca ratio) and/or δ18O and δ13C compositions (at least over the range we explored). Thus, we suggest the following single Δ47-1/T2 linear regression for describing all dolomite minerals: Δ 47 CDES 90 = 0.0428 ( ± 0.0033 ) ∗ 10 6 / T 2 + 0.1174 ( ± 0.0248 ) ( r 2 = 0.997 ) , with T in kelvin and Δ47 in the Carbon Dioxide Equilibrium Scale (CDES) of Dennis et al. (2011) and referring to CO2 extracted by phosphoric acid digestion at 90 °C. The listed uncertainties on slope and intercept are 95\% confidence intervals. The temperature sensitivity (slope) of this relation is lower than those based on low temperature acid digestion of carbonates, but comparable to most of those based on high temperature acid digestion (with however significantly better constraints on the slope and intercept values, notably due to the large range in temperature investigated here and the large number of Δ47 measurements performed, n = 67). We also use this dataset to empirically determine that the acid fractionation factor associated with phosphoric acid digestion of dolomite at 90 °C (Δ*dolomite90) is about +0.176‰. This is comparable to the Δ*calcite90 experimentally obtained for calcite (Guo et al., 2009), suggesting that the acid fractionation Δ* for acid digestion of dolomite and calcite are the same within error of measurement, with apparently no influence of the cation identity. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that our dolomite calibration data are indistinguishable from published calibration data for calcite, aragonite and siderite generated in similar analytical conditions (i.e., carbonate digested at T ⩾ 70 °C and directly referenced into CDES), demonstrating excellent consistency among the four (Ca, Mg, Fe)CO3 mineral phases analyzed in seven different laboratories (this represents a total of 103 mean Δ47 values resulting from more than 331 Δ47 measurements). These data are used to calculate a robust composite Δ47-T universal relation for those carbonate minerals of geological interest, for temperatures between −1 and 300 °C (that is statistically indistinguishable from the one described by dolomite only): Δ 47 CDES 90 = 0.0422 ( ± 0.0019 ) ∗ 10 6 / T 2 + 0.1262 ( ± 0.0207 ) ( r 2 = 0.985 ) Thus, in order to standardize the temperature estimates out of different laboratories running high temperature digestion of (Ca, Mg, Fe)CO3 carbonate minerals, we recommend the use of this single Δ47-T calibration to convert Δ47CDES data into accurate and precise temperature estimates. More widely, this study extends the use of the Δ47 thermometry to studies of diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism of carbonates with unprecedented precision on temperature estimates based on Δ47 measurements — environments where many other thermometers are generally empirical or semi-quantitative.},

Here we show evidence that these deposits formed during a geologically recent ice age that occurred from about 2.1 to 0.4 Myr ago. The deposits were emplaced symmetrically down to latitudes of 30°—equivalent to Saudi Arabia and the southern United States on the Earth—in response to the changing stability of water ice and dust during variations in obliquity (the angle between Mars' pole of rotation and the ecliptic plane) reaching 30–35°. Mars is at present in an 'interglacial' period, and the ice-rich deposits are undergoing reworking, degradation and retreat in response to the current instability of near-surface ice. Unlike the Earth, martian ice ages are characterized by warmer polar climates and enhanced equatorward transport of atmospheric water and dust to produce widespread smooth deposits down to mid-latitudes.},

	abstract = {The Earth's mantle is currently oxidised and out of chemical equilibrium with the core. The reasons for this and for the relatively oxidised state of Earth's mantle relative to the mantles of other terrestrial planets are unclear. It has been proposed that the oxidised nature and high ferric iron (Fe3 +) content of Earth's mantle was produced internally by disproportionation of ferrous iron (Fe2 +) into Fe3 + and metallic iron by perovskite crystallisation during accretion. Here we show that there is substantial Fe isotope fractionation between experimentally equilibrated metal and Fe3 +-bearing perovskite (≥ 0.45‰/amu), which can account for the heavy Fe isotope compositions of terrestrial basalts relative to equivalent samples derived from Mars and Vesta as the latter bodies are too small to stabilise significant perovskite. Mass balance calculations indicate that all of the mantle's Fe3 + could readily have been generated from a single disproportionation event, consistent with dissolution of perovskite in the lower mantle during a process such as the Moon-forming giant impact. The similar Fe isotope compositions of primitive terrestrial and low-titanium lunar basalts is consistent with models of equilibration between the mantles of the Earth and Moon in the aftermath of the giant impact and suggests that the heavy Fe isotope composition of the Earth's mantle was established prior to, or during the giant impact. The oxidation state and ferric iron content of the Earth's mantle was therefore plausibly set by the end of accretion, and may be decoupled from later volatile additions and the rise of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere at 2.45 Ga.},

	abstract = {The density profile of an SNC model Martian interior is calculated from the results of previous experimental work that determined the modal mineralogy of the model mantle up to Martian core-mantle boundary pressures. The moment-of-inertia factor of Mars is calculated as a function of core composition and crustal thickness using the SNC model mantle density profile as a constraint. Two sets of calculations are performed. In the first, the bulk composition of the planet is not constrained to a C1 chondrite composition. Assuming a Martian crust density of 2.7–3.0 g/cm3, a crust thickness of 25–150 km, and the core composition proposed by Dreibus and Wänke, Fe 14 wt\% S, the calculated moment-of-inertia factor ranges from 0.367 to 0.357. These models include a perovskite-bearing zone in the Martian interior. Considering core compositions ranging from pure Fe to pure FeS changes the moment-of-inertia factor by only ±0.001, but at higher S abundances, core size increases, such that the depth of the core-mantle boundary is shallower than the depth of perovskite stability. In the second set of calculations, the bulk composition of the planet is constrained to a C1 composition requiring a crust thickness of 180–320 km, assuming a crust density of 2.7–3.0 g/cm3. The calculated moment-of-inertia factor is 0.354 and a perovskite-bearing layer is absent from the Martian interior. As it is unlikely that the thickness of the Martian crust is greater than 100 km, the bulk composition of Mars cannot be constrained to a C1 chondrite composition as proposed by the Dreibus and Wänke model (G. Dreibus, H. Wänke, Meteoritics 20 (1985) 367–382). In order to determine if the Martian mantle is more iron-rich than the Earth's mantle, we may need not only an improved estimate of the moment-of-inertia factor of Mars, but also tighter constraints on Martian crust thickness and density. The absolute degree of iron-enrichment, however, cannot be specified without also knowing the size of the Martian core. A moment-of-inertia factor of less than 0.342 is not geochemically feasible, because it requires that the mantle of Mars contains no iron.},

Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration. The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later, and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (1 au is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 au, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 au; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 au and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial planets are thought to have formed through collisions between large planetary embryos of diameter [sim]1,000-5,000 km. For Earth, the last of these collisions involved an impact by a Mars-size embryo that formed the Moon 50-150 million years (Myr) after the birth of the Solar System. Although model simulations of the growth of terrestrial planets can reproduce the mass and dynamical parameters of the Earth and Venus, they fall short of explaining the small size of Mars. One possibility is that Mars was a planetary embryo that escaped collision and merging with other embryos. To assess this idea, it is crucial to know Mars/' accretion timescale, which can be investigated using the 182Hf-182W decay system in shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite meteorites. Nevertheless, this timescale remains poorly constrained owing to a large uncertainty associated with the Hf/W ratio of the Martian mantle and as a result, contradicting timescales have been reported that range between 0 and 15 Myr (refs 6-10). Here we show that Mars accreted very rapidly and reached about half of its present size in only nature10077-m4jpg9245021 Myr or less, which is consistent with a stranded planetary embryo origin. We have found a well-defined correlation between the Th/Hf and 176Hf/177Hf ratios in chondrites that reflects remobilization of Lu and Th during parent-body processes. Using this relationship, we estimate the Hf/W ratio in Mars/' mantle to be 3.51 ± 0.45. This value is much more precise than previous estimates, which ranged between 2.6 and 5.0 (ref. 6), and lifts the large uncertainty that plagued previous estimates of the age of Mars. Our results also demonstrate that Mars grew before dissipation of the nebular gas when [sim]100-km planetesimals, such as the parent bodies of chondrites, were still being formed. Mars/' accretion occurred early enough to allow establishment of a magma ocean powered by decay of 26Al.},

I argue that the small mass of Mars requires the terrestrial planets to have formed from a narrow annulus of material, rather than a disc extending to Jupiter. The truncation of the outer edge of the disc was most likely the result of giant planet migration, which kept Mars’ mass small. From cosmochemical constraints it is argued that Mars formed in a couple of million years and is essentially a planetary embryo that never grew to a full-fledged planet. This is in agreement with the latest dynamical models. Most of Mars’ building blocks consists of material that formed in the 2 AU to 3 AU region, and is thus more water-rich than that accreted by Earth and Venus. The putative Mars could have consisted of 0.1 \% to 0.2 \% by mass of water.},

The current best estimate of climate sensitivity is similar to the earliest estimates by Arrhenius (2) and Callendar (3), ranging from 2° to 4.5°C (4). Constraints on the lower limit of this range are much tighter than they are on the upper limit, with small but finite probabilities for very large climate sensitivities (4). Although the geological record provides strong support for climate sensitivities in this range, it also reminds us that a single value of climate sensitivity is unlikely to provide a complete picture of the climate system's response to forcing.
The paleoclimate record suggests that certain aspects of climate change may be difficult to reconcile with a single value of climate sensitivity.

To prevent these and limit long-term global surface warming to, for example, 2 °C, a level of stabilization or of peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations needs to be set. Climate sensitivity, the global equilibrium surface warming after a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration, can help with the translation of atmospheric CO2 levels to warming. Various observations favour a climate sensitivity value of about 3 °C, with a likely range of about 2–4.5 °C. However, the physics of the response and uncertainties in forcing lead to fundamental difficulties in ruling out higher values. The quest to determine climate sensitivity has now been going on for decades, with disturbingly little progress in narrowing the large uncertainty range. However, in the process, fascinating new insights into the climate system and into policy aspects regarding mitigation have been gained. The well-constrained lower limit of climate sensitivity and the transient rate of warming already provide useful information for policy makers.

To understand this increasingly complex geology, we must understand the initial formation and evolution of the LMO, and the composition of the cumulates this differentiation could have produced. Several attempts at modelling such a crystallization sequence have been made, and have raised as many questions as they have answered. We present results from our ongoing experimental simulations of magma ocean crystallization, investigating two end-member bulk compositions  under fully fractional crystallization conditions. These simulations represent melting of the entire silicate portion of the Moon, as an end-member starting point from which to begin assessing the evolution of the lunar interior and formation of the lunar crust.},

However, it is difficult to reconcile giant-impact models with the compositional similarity of the Earth and Moon without violating angular momentum constraints. Furthermore, successful giant-impact scenarios require very specific conditions such that they have a low probability of occurring. Here we present numerical simulations suggesting that the Moon could instead be the product of a succession of a variety of smaller collisions. In this scenario, each collision forms a debris disk around the proto-Earth that then accretes to form a moonlet. The moonlets tidally advance outward, and may coalesce to form the Moon. We find that sub-lunar moonlets are a common result of impacts expected onto the proto-Earth in the early Solar System and find that the planetary rotation is limited by impact angular momentum drain. We conclude that, assuming efficient merger of moonlets, a multiple-impact scenario can account for the formation of the Earth–Moon system with its present properties.},

How did the Moon form? According to the prevailing hypothesis, a Mars-sized body known as Theia smashed into Earth. Herwartz et al. analyzed fresh basalt samples from three Apollo landing sites and compared them with several samples of Earth's mantle. The oxygen isotope values measured in these lunar rocks differ significantly from the terrestrial material, supporting the giant-impact hypothesis.
Science, this issue p. 1146
The Moon was probably formed by a catastrophic collision of the proto-Earth with a planetesimal named Theia. Most numerical models of this collision imply a higher portion of Theia in the Moon than in Earth. Because of the isotope heterogeneity among solar system bodies, the isotopic composition of Earth and the Moon should thus be distinct. So far, however, all attempts to identify the isotopic component of Theia in lunar rocks have failed. Our triple oxygen isotope data reveal a 12 ± 3 parts per million difference in Δ17O between Earth and the Moon, which supports the giant impact hypothesis of Moon formation. We also show that enstatite chondrites and Earth have different Δ17O values, and we speculate on an enstatite chondrite–like composition of Theia. The observed small compositional difference could alternatively be explained by a carbonaceous chondrite–dominated late veneer.
Isotopic oxygen measurements suggest that the Moon comprises material distinct from Earth’s mantle.

Previous Moon-formation studies assumed that the angular momentum after the impact was similar to that of the present day; however, Earth-mass planets are expected to have higher spin rates at the end of accretion. Here, we show that typical last giant impacts onto a fast-spinning proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming disk derived primarily from Earth’s mantle. Furthermore, we find that a faster-spinning early Earth-Moon system can lose angular momentum and reach the present state through an orbital resonance between the Sun and Moon.

The impact orientation and size are constrained by the angular momentum contained in both the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, a quantity that has been nearly conserved over the past 4.5 billion years. Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth–Moon system has proved difficult. Previous works found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller—and thus more likely—object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

	abstract = {The Earth–Moon system has unique chemical and isotopic signatures compared with other planetary bodies; any successful model for the origin of this system therefore has to satisfy these chemical and isotopic constraints. The Moon is substantially depleted in volatile elements such as potassium compared with the Earth and the bulk solar composition, and it has long been thought to be the result of a catastrophic Moon-forming giant impact event. Volatile-element-depleted bodies such as the Moon were expected to be enriched in heavy potassium isotopes during the loss of volatiles; however such enrichment was never found. Here we report new high-precision potassium isotope data for the Earth, the Moon and chondritic meteorites. We found that the lunar rocks are significantly ({\textgreater}2σ) enriched in the heavy isotopes of potassium compared to the Earth and chondrites (by around 0.4 parts per thousand). The enrichment of the heavy isotope of potassium in lunar rocks compared with those of the Earth and chondrites can be best explained as the result of the incomplete condensation of a bulk silicate Earth vapour at an ambient pressure that is higher than 10 bar. We used these coupled constraints of the chemical loss and isotopic fractionation of K to compare two recent dynamic models that were used to explain the identical non-mass-dependent isotope composition of the Earth and the Moon. Our K isotope result is inconsistent with the low-energy disk equilibration model, but supports the high-energy, high-angular-momentum giant impact model for the origin of the Moon. High-precision potassium isotope data can also be used as a ‘palaeo-barometer’ to reveal the physical conditions during the Moon-forming event.},

	abstract = {A long-standing paradigm assumes that the chemical and isotopic compositions of many elements in the bulk silicate Earth are the same as in chondrites. However, the accessible Earth has a greater 142Nd/144Nd ratio than do chondrites. Because 142Nd is the decay product of the now-extinct 146Sm (which has a half-life of 103 million years), this 142Nd difference seems to require a higher-than-chondritic Sm/Nd ratio for the accessible Earth. This must have been acquired during global silicate differentiation within the first 30 million years of Solar System formation and implies the formation of a complementary 142Nd-depleted reservoir that either is hidden in the deep Earth, or lost to space by impact erosion. Whether this complementary reservoir existed, and whether or not it has been lost from Earth, is a matter of debate, and has implications for determining the bulk composition of Earth, its heat content and structure, as well as for constraining the modes and timescales of its geodynamical evolution. Here we show that, compared with chondrites, Earth’s precursor bodies were enriched in neodymium that was produced by the slow neutron capture process (s-process) of nucleosynthesis. This s-process excess leads to higher 142Nd/144Nd ratios; after correction for this effect, the 142Nd/144Nd ratios of chondrites and the accessible Earth are indistinguishable within five parts per million. The 142Nd offset between the accessible silicate Earth and chondrites therefore reflects a higher proportion of s-process neodymium in the Earth, and not early differentiation processes. As such, our results obviate the need for hidden-reservoir or super-chondritic Earth models and imply a chondritic Sm/Nd ratio for the bulk Earth. Although chondrites formed at greater heliocentric distances and contain a different mix of presolar components than Earth, they nevertheless are suitable proxies for Earth’s bulk chemical composition.},

We infer that thermal processing of molecular cloud material, probably associated with volatile-element depletions in the inner solar system, resulted in selective destruction of thermally unstable, isotopically anomalous presolar components, producing residual isotopic heterogeneity. This implies that terrestrial planets accreted from thermally processed solids with nonsolar isotopic compositions.},

	abstract = {The early evolution of the solar nebula involved substantial transport of mass, resulting in mixing and homogenization of isotopically diverse materials that were contributed to the solar system from multiple stellar nucleosynthetic sources. The efficiency of this mixing, as well as its timescale can be quantified by determining nucleosynthetic isotope variations among meteorites and terrestrial planets. Here we present Mo isotopic data for a wide range of samples, including Ca–Al-rich inclusions, chondrites and differentiated meteorites, as well as martian and terrestrial samples. Most meteorites are depleted in s-process Mo relative to the Earth, and only the IAB–IIICD irons, angrites and martian meteorites have terrestrial Mo isotopic compositions. In contrast, most Ca–Al-rich inclusions are enriched in r-process Mo, but one inclusion is characterized by a large s-process deficit. Molybdenum isotopic anomalies in the bulk meteorites correlate with those in Ru exactly as predicted from nucleosynthetic theory, but no obvious correlation is apparent between Mo and Ni anomalies. Therefore, s-process Mo and Ru seem to be hosted in the same carrier, which must be distinct from the carrier responsible for isotopic anomalies in the Fe-group elements (Ni, Cr, Ti). Furthermore, the isotopic heterogeneity in Mo (and other elements) contrasts with the isotopic homogeneity for Hf and Os, indicating that different s-process carriers once existed in the early solar nebula and that only some of these were heterogeneously distributed. The Mo isotopic anomalies of meteorites and their components decrease over time and with increasing size of the parent bodies, providing evidence for a progressive homogenization of the solar nebula. However, the carbonaceous chondrites exhibit larger Mo anomalies than expected for their age, indicating that they received a greater portion of material from the outer solar system (where homogenization was slow) than other meteorite parent bodies and terrestrial planets.
Compared to the meteorites, Earth is enriched in s-process Mo and must have accreted from material distinct from the meteorites. Combined Mo and O isotopic data show that the composition of the Earth cannot be reconstructed by any known combination of meteorites, implying that meteorites may be inappropriate proxies for the isotopic composition of the bulk Earth. This is exemplified by the covariation of 92Mo and 142Nd anomalies in chondrites, showing that the 142Nd deficit of chondrites compared to the accessible Earth may not unequivocally be interpreted as a signature of an early differentiation of the Earth. However, further high precision isotopic data are needed to evaluate the role of chondrites in defining the isotopic composition of the Earth.},

	abstract = {The chemical weathering of rocks with sulfuric acid is usually not considered in reconstructions of the past evolution of the carbon cycle, although this reaction delivers cations and alkalinity to the ocean without involvement of atmospheric CO2. The contribution of sulfuric acid as a weathering agent is still poorly quantified; the identification of riverine sulfate sources is difficult. The use of δ34S and δ18O of dissolved sulfate allows us to demonstrate that most of the sulfate in surface waters of the Mackenzie River system, Canada, derives from pyrite oxidation (85\% ± 5\%) and not from sedimentary sulfate. The calculated flux of pyrite-derived sulfate is 0.13 × 1012 mol/yr, corresponding to 20\%–27\% of the estimated global budget. This result suggests that the modern global ocean delivery of sulfide-derived sulfate, and thus chemical weathering with sulfuric acid, may be significantly underestimated. A strong correlation between sulfide oxidation rates and mechanical erosion rates suggests that the exposure of fresh mineral surfaces is the rate-limiting factor of sulfide oxidation in the subbasins investigated. The chemical weathering budget of the Mackenzie River shows that more than half of the dissolved inorganic carbon discharged to the ocean is ancient sedimentary carbon from carbonate (62\%) and not atmospheric carbon (38\%). The subsequent carbonate precipitation in the ocean will thus release more CO2 in the atmosphere-ocean system than that consumed by continental weathering, typically on glacial-interglacial time scales.},

The efficiency of organic carbon deposition in sedimentary basins is however limited by the organic carbon load capacity of the sediments and organic carbon oxidation in continental margins. At the global scale, previous studies have suggested that about 70 per cent of riverine organic carbon is returned to the atmosphere, such as in the Amazon basin. Here we present a comprehensive organic carbon budget for the Himalayan erosional system, including source rocks, river sediments and marine sediments buried in the Bengal fan. We show that organic carbon export is controlled by sediment properties, and that oxidative loss is negligible during transport and deposition to the ocean. Our results indicate that 70 to 85 per cent of the organic carbon is recent organic matter captured during transport, which serves as a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The amount of organic carbon deposited in the Bengal basin represents about 10 to 20 per cent of the total terrestrial organic carbon buried in oceanic sediments. High erosion rates in the Himalayas generate high sedimentation rates and low oxygen availability in the Bay of Bengal that sustain the observed extreme organic carbon burial efficiency. Active orogenic systems generate enhanced physical erosion and the resulting organic carbon burial buffers atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, thereby exerting a negative feedback on climate over geological timescales.},

	abstract = {The observed stability of Earth/'s climate over millions of years is thought to depend on the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) release from the solid Earth being balanced by the rate of CO2 consumption by silicate weathering. During the Cenozoic era, spanning approximately the past 66 million years, the concurrent increases in the marine isotopic ratios of strontium, osmium and lithium suggest that extensive uplift of mountain ranges may have stimulated CO2 consumption by silicate weathering, but reconstructions of sea-floor spreading do not indicate a corresponding increase in CO2 inputs from volcanic degassing. The resulting imbalance would have depleted the atmosphere of all CO2 within a few million years. As a result, reconciling Cenozoic isotopic records with the need for mass balance in the long-term carbon cycle has been a major and unresolved challenge in geochemistry and Earth history. Here we show that enhanced sulphide oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution can provide a transient source of CO2 to Earth/'s atmosphere that is relevant over geological timescales. Like drawdown by means of silicate weathering, this source is probably enhanced by tectonic uplift, and so may have contributed to the relative stability of the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic. A variety of other hypotheses have been put forward to explain the /`Cenozoic isotope-weathering paradox/', and the evolution of the carbon cycle probably depended on multiple processes. However, an important role for sulphide oxidation coupled to carbonate dissolution is consistent with records of radiogenic isotopes, atmospheric CO2 partial pressure and the evolution of the Cenozoic sulphur cycle, and could be accounted for by geologically reasonable changes in the global dioxygen cycle, suggesting that this CO2 source should be considered a potentially important but as yet generally unrecognized component of the long-term carbon cycle.},

In this work, first published between 1849 and 1858, Fellows of the Royal Society Richard Owen (1804-92) and Thomas Bell (1792-1880) describe their findings from among the reptilian fossils found there. The book is divided into four parts, covering chelonian, crocodilian, lacertilian and ophidian fossils, and includes an extensive section of detailed illustrations. Using his characteristic 'bone to bone' method and an emphasis on taxonomy, Owen draws some significant conclusions; he shows that some of Cuvier's classifications were wrongly extended to marine turtles, and adds to the evidence for an Eocene period much warmer than the present. The work is a fascinating example of pre-Darwinian palaeontology by two scientists later much involved in the evolutionary controversy.},

The London Clay Sea is considered to have transgressed from a region of continuous Palaeocene-Lower Eocene sedimentation in the Danish-NW. German area, where it opened north-westwards, over Holland, Belgium and much of the London Basin, then to have transgressed farther over the Hampshire Basin to a Tethyan connection over the English Channel, finally to have retreated eastwards over S. England. The famous tropical flora is considered to have grown on the south-western coasts. The London Basin lower clays are probably represented by Reading Beds in the Hampshire Basin, and the English and Belgian London Clay by non-marine Sparnacian in the Paris Basin. It is recommended that a division into Palaeocene and Lower Eocene is adequate for the pre-Lutetian tertiaries of north-western Europe, instead of stage-names now in use; formation-names are unaffected.

	abstract = {Down-core trends for extents of iron sulfidation in upper Holocene microlaminated deposits of the Black Sea abyssal plain imply that most of the pyrite in these sediments is formed in the sulfidic water column and/or very close to the sediment-water interface. Sulfur isotopic data for pyrite within microlaminated muds from two localities in the deep basin show striking uniformity between sites and down core, with a mean δ34SCDT value of −37.2 ± 0.9‰ (1σ, n = 18). These isotopic trends support the hypothesis of early pyrite formation.

Isotopic compositions of pyrite sulfur in the microlaminated bottom sediments are similar to those reported for particulate reduced sulfur collected in middepth sediment traps and toδ34S values for water-column dissolved sulfide within a narrow zone immediately below the O2/H2S interface. These three sulfur reservoirs are distinctly different from the isotopic composition of ambient dissolved sulfide of the deep water column (\&gt;175 m), with δ34S values for the deep dissolved sulfide reservoir being consistently lower by ∼2 to 4‰. These isotopic relationships suggest that iron sulfidation is occurring dominantly within a narrow, shallow region at the top of the sulfidic water mass.

Isotopic data from a fine-grained turbidite collected in the deep basin and from rapidly accumulating, iron monosulfide-rich muds on the anoxic upper slope are enriched in34S relative to the microlaminated deposits. The enrichments on the basin margin reflect a large component of iron sulfide formed during rapid burial. A broad suite of geochemical data, including sulfur isotopic results, are consistent with an upper-slope sediment source for the ubiquitous muddy turbidites of the deep basin. The collective effects of reworking, transport, and redeposition result in a complete conversion of AVS to pyrite with little additional iron sulfidation. This conclusion is supported by a detailed isotopic mass balance.

The present isotopic study also highlights fundamental differences in the reactivities of the iron reservoirs distributed throughout the anoxic basin. Sediments of the upper slope and the genetically-linked turbidites of the deep basin show similar extents of iron sulfidation that are significantly lower than those of the microlaminated deposits of the deep-basin floor, suggesting dramatically shorter timescales of iron reactivity for the microlaminated sediments of the deep basin. Importantly, isotopic patterns from the modern Black Sea should assist greatly in the recognition and interpretation of ancient anoxia in the stratigraphic record.},

In this study, we investigate how the coupling of carbon and sulfur metabolisms in batch and continuous cultures of a recently isolated marine sulfate reducing bacterium DMSS-1, a Desulfovibrio sp., influences the fractionation of sulfur isotopes.

DMSS-1 grown in batch culture on seven different electron donors (ethanol, glycerol, fructose, glucose, lactate, malate and pyruvate) fractionates 34S/32S ratio from 6‰ to 44‰, demonstrating that the fractionations by an actively growing culture of a single incomplete oxidizing sulfate reducing microbe can span almost the entire range of previously reported values in defined cultures. The magnitude of isotope effect correlates well with cell specific sulfate reduction rates (from 0.7 to 26.1 fmol/cell/day). DMSS-1 grown on lactate in continuous culture produces a larger isotope effect (21–37‰) than the lactate-grown batch culture (6‰), indicating that the isotope effect also depends on the supply rate of the electron donor and microbial growth rate. The largest isotope effect in continuous culture is accompanied by measurable changes in cell length and cellular yield that suggest starvation. The use of multiple sulfur isotopes in the model of metabolic fluxes of sulfur shows that the loss of sulfate from the cell and the intracellular reoxidation of reduced sulfur species contribute to the increase in isotope effects in a correlated manner. Isotope fractionations produced during sulfate reduction in the pure culture of DMSS-1 expand the previously reported range of triple sulfur isotope effects (32S, 33S, and 34S) by marine sulfate reducing bacteria, implying that microbial sulfur disproportionation may have a smaller 33S isotopic fingerprint than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Phanerozoic levels of atmospheric oxygen relate to the burial histories of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur. The sulfur cycle remains poorly constrained, however, leading to concomitant uncertainties in O2 budgets. Here we present experiments linking the magnitude of fractionations of the multiple sulfur isotopes to the rate of microbial sulfate reduction. The data demonstrate that such fractionations are controlled by the availability of electron donor (organic matter), rather than by the concentration of electron acceptor (sulfate), an environmental constraint that varies among sedimentary burial environments. By coupling these results with a sediment biogeochemical model of pyrite burial, we find a strong relationship between observed sulfur isotope fractionations over the last 200 Ma and the areal extent of shallow seafloor environments. We interpret this as a global dependency of the rate of microbial sulfate reduction on the availability of organic-rich sea-floor settings. However, fractionation during the early/mid-Paleozoic fails to correlate with shelf area. We suggest that this decoupling reflects a shallower paleoredox boundary, primarily confined to the water column in the early Phanerozoic. The transition between these two states begins during the Carboniferous and concludes approximately around the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, indicating a prolonged response to a Carboniferous rise in O2. Together, these results lay the foundation for decoupling changes in sulfate reduction rates from the global average record of pyrite burial, highlighting how the local nature of sedimentary processes affects global records. This distinction greatly refines our understanding of the S cycle and its relationship to the history of atmospheric oxygen.},

However, recent research proposed the terrestrial Termitichnus ichnofacies as a subset of the Scoyenia ichnofacies. The Mermia ichnofacies is formally defined herein to include nonmarine, fully aquatic trace fossil suites characterized by the dominance of horizontal to subhorizontal grazing and feeding traces produced by mobile deposit feeders, the subordinate occurrence of locomotion traces, overall high to moderate ichnodiversity and abundance, and low specialized grazing patterns. The Mermia ichnofacies typifies unconsolidated, fine‐grained, permanent subaqueous substrates, and well‐oxygenated, low‐energy lake bottoms, periodically punctuated by episodic sedimentation. In addition, it is suggested to include in the Scoyenia ichnofacies, floodplain and transitional fluvio‐lacustrine trace fossil assemblages dominated by arthropod trackways, regardless of the presence of back‐filled meniscate burrows. In the nonmarine ichnofacies model proposed herein, the Scoyenia, Termitichnus, and Mermia ichnofacies are considered at the same hierarchical level. The Termitichnus ichnofacies is characteristic of terrestrial sediments, while the Scoyenia ichnofacies typifies transitional terrestrial/nonmarine aquatic environments, and the Mermia ichnofacies indicates nonmarine fully aquatic deposits. Various non‐marine ichnofacies remain unrecognized, potentially including ichnofaunas from dunes, fluvial channels, dry interdunes, and wave‐dominated lacustrine shorelines, as well as continental wood‐grounds, firmgrounds, and hardgrounds.},

	abstract = {The Homeb Silt Formation consists of eroded remnants of fine-grained alluvium that were deposited within the Kuiseb River valley in southern Namibia during the Late Pleistocene. In Holocene times the river deeply incised its valley fill leaving steep walled “castles” of relict alluvium—the Homeb Silts. This study is based on the 25 m thick type exposure of Homeb Silts at Homeb and describes flash-flood sediments that were colonised by successive generations of opportunistic arthropods. The stacked flood units each comprise a massive tabular siltstone bed overlain by a narrower interval of rapidly alternating sandstone and siltstone with claystone veneers. These flood units are interpreted as having accumulated under semi-arid climatic conditions by episodic back-flooding of the Kuiseb River into embayments and tributary mouths.

Soon after deposition as the floodwaters subsided, the sediment was colonised by burrowing, sediment-ingesting organisms, mostly arthropods, that produced a Taenidium ichnofacies. After the floodwaters had drained, the exposed sediment was colonised by grasses and burrowed by terrestrial arthropods, probably ants and termites, resulting in an overprint of Termitichnus ichnofacies with associated pelletal chambers.

Thirteen “horizons” of rhizocretions and root tubules occur toward the top of the succession and indicate a gradual reduction in the frequency of flooding. These immature calcic palaeosols suggest that the climate in the Central Namib Desert 20,000 years ago was semi-arid, being wetter and more seasonal than the hyperarid conditions that prevail today.},

The dykes, typically less than 25 cm wide and 40 cm in vertical extent, project downward into clayshale from broad loads at the base of elongate isolated lenses of hummocky cross-stratified siltstone. Ptygmatic folding of the dykes reflects a shale: siltstone compaction ratio of 2.3 times, and maximum depth of dyke penetration prior to compaction was \&gt; 1 m. Dyke orientation parallels the orientation of wave-ripple crests and the elongation direction of the siltstone lenses. Dyke formation was penecontemporaneous with sedimentation.

Dyke and load formation was probably initiated in shallow water during storms which promoted sediment failure through cyclic wave loading, microseisms and rapid deposition of HCS-bearing siltstone lenses. Reversed-density gradient and uneven sediment loading from silt lenses probably promoted downward emplacement. Loads reflect ductile failure of surficial water-rich mud, whereas dykes reflect downward injection of silt following brittle failure of underlying, more compacted mud. The depositional slope provided a tensional stress that controlled the fracture direction (orthogonal to the slope) of the failed sediment.},

In Labrador the formation rests directly on a low relief surface, developed on metamorphic rocks of the Grenville Orogen, with no well developed paleosoils. Re-examination of the architecture of pebbly sandstones in the basal (Blanc-Sablon) member indicate that these formed on an open, storm-influenced wave-swept shelf as part of a low relief sand sheet, with evidence of multiple accretionary events. Structure in sandstones in the middle (Crow Head) member is largely obscured by a high density of Skolithos linearis domichnia. Abundance of hummocky cross stratification indicates deepening, with a transition to an open, storm-influenced, shallow shelf. Large-scale cross stratification in the glauconite-bearing upper (L'Anse-au-Clair) member reflects shoaling, with a return to deposition of medium-scale marine sandwave complexes, with no clear evidence of any tidal signature. Strata of the Bradore Formation were at least partly lithified prior to deposition of reefal and platformal carbonates in the overlying Forteau Formation. Paleocurrent indicators in the upper and lower members suggests that during the initial drift phase of Iapetus this segment (St Lawrence Promontory) of the Laurentian margin was swept by both geostrophic and storm-influenced currents, largely oriented parallel to the paleocoastline.},

	abstract = {Cratonic quartz sandstones have presented several intractable problems. Besides their extreme textural and compositional maturity and paucity of shale, their sheet-like geometry is particularly notable. If the sandstones were entirely marine, as long supposed, such geometry is difficult to explain in terms of modern shelf sediments, which are generally held to be either relict or only slightly reworked by the Holocene transgression (palimpsest). Re-study of two quartz sandstones in the northern Mississippi Valley region reveals evidence for significant non-marine deposition followed by varying degrees of marine reworking during transgressions. Facies patterns are similar in the Cambrian Wonewoc and Ordovician St Peter sandstones, both of which overlie unconformities. In both, a large-scale cross-stratified facies believed to represent aeolian ergs passes laterally into a planar-and-channelled facies inferred to represent sand plains composed of braided fluvial and aeolian sand sheet deposits. Criteria of aeolian deposition in both facies include adhesion structures, large ripple index, fine climbing translatent lamination, grainfall and grainflow stratification. Criteria of braided fluvial deposition include shallow channels containing sequences of thinning-upward sets of trough cross-stratification, reactivation surfaces, low-index ripples, and polygonal cracks. Probable aeolian sand sheets contain flat bedding punctuated by small channels, adhesion structures, and coarse-sand ripples with large index. There is a conspicuous absence of trace and body fossils from these inferred non-marine deposits. In contrast is a burrowed and trough cross-stratified facies characterized by medium-scale cross-bedding alternating with bioturbated intervals and rare brachiopod or trilobite-mould coquinas, which is interpreted as shallow marine. In both formations, this last facies replaces laterally and overlaps the other two, reflecting transgression and variable reworking. The main areas of non-marine deposits in both formations are capped by a thin, burrowed subfacies that represents the culmination of each transgression; that is, a stillstand during which sediment influx ceased and both physical winnowing and bioturbation were intense. It is suggested that the sheet-like geometry of many cratonic quartz sandstones is due primarily to initial sand dispersal by aeolian and fluvial processes. That such processes must have been orders-of-magnitude more important on pre-Devonian, vegetation-free landscapes than they have been since, not only helps to explain the sheet-like character but also the exceptional maturity of the older cratonic sandstones.},

	abstract = {Coexisting dissolved sulfide and sulfate from hypersulfidic interstitial waters of a 380- m-long sediment core show a large isotopic difference of up to 72‰ caused by in situ microbial sulfate reduction. This is considerably larger than the assumed biological maximum of 46‰ derived from laboratory studies with pure cultures of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Similar high fractionations inferred from sedimentary metal sulfides have been previously explained by a multistage process, involving sulfide reoxidation and disproportionation of sulfur intermediates. Our data show that extreme isotopic differences between sulfate and the reduced sulfur species can also be generated during microbial single-step fractionation. This result indicates that the sulfate-reducing communities and/or their cellular metabolic activities in the deep biosphere may differ from those observed in near-surface sediments or the water column.},

The Applecross Formation comprises over 3000 m of homogeneous, cross-bedded, coarse to pebbly red sandstone with little mudstone, and few reliable stratigraphical markers. Its accumulation pre-dates the advent of land vegetation that took place from Ordovician times. Depositional architecture is characterised by laterally extensive sandstone bodies representing a braided fluvial system with high width-to-depth ratio channels. Soft-sediment deformation structures are abundant, complex in geometry and large in scale. Using criteria relating to the driving forces, deformation mechanism and timing of deformation, distinct styles of soft-sediment deformation are recognised. They relate to liquefaction or fluidization triggered by: (1) flood-induced turbulence or rapid sedimentation in active channels; (2) seismically induced liquefaction of near-surface waterlogged sediment in active or recently active terminal splays; and (3) fluidization by upwelling groundwater in inactive parts of the system, possibly near the toes of inter-channel areas of distributive fluvial systems and triggered by earthquakes or groundwater movements. The soft-sediment deformation demonstrates that groundwater levels remained high in inactive parts of the fluvial system and this is likely a contributing factor to the unusual abundance of soft-sediment deformation in the Applecross Formation.},

belts are superbly exposed along the seaboard of Stoer Peninsula,
Scotland, UK. The deposits belong to the Applecross Formation, part of
the Torridonian succession, and their planview style and palaeodrainage
are reconstructed at three sites. In-channel deposits record both active
and abandonment stages, while soft-sediment deformation calls for local
failure of cohesion-less deposits and/or effects of seismic events.
Channel belts comprise compound-bar sheets and large foreset bars, as
well as channel bodies with rarely preserved levees. In most cases bars
show downstream accretion, though lateral and upstream growth is also
evident along reactivated bar flanks and heads, respectively. While
these features are distinctive of active braided-channel belts,
scattered trunk-channel bodies with preserved levees point to local
embankment of deep streams with somewhat limited lateral mobility.

Profusion of thick cross-bedding calls for perennial discharge in
channels with depth in the order of 13 m, suggesting a mature,
large-scale fluvial drainage capable of transporting sediment for
hundreds to thousands of km. While entire channel belts yield
width:thickness ratios exceeding 320, single channel bodies with ratios
of 20 to 80 better reconcile with a channelled rather than sheet braided
fluvial model, a feature in contrast with classic models for
pre-vegetation rivers. Though some degree of uncertainty exists when
applying Phanerozoic-derived models to Torridonian rivers, the latter
could have been controlled by cycles of discharge to sediment supply
that alternated aggradation and degradation, with patterns of bar
buildup and reworking comparable to those observed in modern braided
rivers.},

In a typical cycle, transgressive normal-marine shelf carbonates are succeeded by marine shales, then highstand prodelta mudstones and delta front-delta top sandstones with local coals. A detailed study of one cycle, the Great Limestone Cyclothem of the northern Pennines (Alston Block), reveals that within the transgressive carbonates, the beds, averaging 75 cm in thickness and defined by mm-shale partings or cm-mudrock layers, form two thinning-upward to thickening-upward bed-sets. Individual beds and the bed-sets can be correlated across the region. Oxygen isotope and strontium trace element data also reveal patterns of increasing and decreasing values through the limestone, which broadly correspond to the bed-thickness cycles.

The beds are interpreted as millennial-scale cycles, the result of high-frequency, arid–humid climatic fluctuations. The bed-sets are interpreted as the response to a longer term arid–humid climate and sea-level cycle, driven by the precession rhythm.

It is postulated that millennial-scale climatic changes, which are a well-known feature of the Quaternary and are here inferred for the Carboniferous, were responsible for the deposition of the beds that are a characteristic feature of many marine sedimentary successions in the geological record. The most likely over-riding control is fluctuations in solar output.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACTLocally abundant and diverse brachiopod faunas, associated with unstable outer shelf and slope environments, occur throughout the Barr and Ardmillan groups (middle Llanvirn–upper Ashgill) in the Girvan district of SW Scotland. A dataset of 350 brachiopod species from 30 horizons through the Middle–Upper Ordovician succession forms the basis for a description of brachiopod diversity through the succession and comparison with global patterns and trends through this time interval. The Middle Ordovician Barr Group incorporates shallow water carbonate and clastic facies, characterised by Valcourea confinis, with deeper-water facies. The trilobite-dominated Albany Group preserves outer shelf biofacies. Deep-water facies occur in the Balclatchie Formation of the lower Ardmillan Group, including an early occurrence of a Foliomena-type species. High diversity brachiopod faunas occur in clastic facies, though many of the biofacies have a transported component to them. Representatives of the deep-water Foliomena fauna occur intermittently throughout the Upper Ardmillan Group, appearing in both the Whitehouse and Drummuck subgroups. This distinctive assemblage of small, thin-shelled brachiopods, including Dedzetina, Christiania, Cyclospira and Foliomena itself, is interbedded with a variety of other less cosmopolitan deep-water assemblages, including the Onniella–Skenidioides and Lingulella–Trimurellina associations. Shallower-water environments in the middle Ashgill Lower Drummuck Subgroup hosted the Fardenia–Eopholidostrophia association in sands, and the Christiania–Leptaena association in muds and silts. The remarkable Lady Burn Starfish Beds in the upper part of the group contain a variety of brachiopod-dominated assemblages, including the Eochonetes and Plaesiomys–Schizophorella associations, transported from various shelf locations, within a very diverse mid Ashgill biota. The upper Ashgill High Mains Formation contains abundant elements of the terminal Ordovician Hirnantia fauna, including Eostropheodonta, Hindella and Hirnantia itself, but also some taxa more typical of the Laurentian Edgewood Province. As a whole, the changing brachiopod biodiversity biofacies reflect environmental fluctuations, on this part of the Laurentian margin, driven by mainly eustatic and tectonic events against a background of global biotic radiation.},

	abstract = {The pore waters in sedimentary basins are ultimately derived from sea water, meteoric water, mineral bound water, or from the underlying basement. Geochemically these waters initially have different signatures; however, the pore water compositions are easily altered by reactions with minerals or by mixing with other fluids. Meteoric water is driven downwards into sedimentary basins by the gravitational potential, which approximately corresponds to the elevation of the ground water table above the sea or lake level. It is difficult to model such flow, however, because the permeability on a large scale is almost impossible to represent realistically. The continuity of confined sandstone and limestone aquifers plays an important role in determining the flux of meteoric water received by rocks in different parts of the basin, but this is again difficult to predict. Pore water flow driven by compaction typically has velocities several orders of magnitude lower than what is commonly found in meteoric water flow regimes. The average rate of upwards flow is lower than the rate of subsidence and the difference is the rate of incorporation of sea water in the topmost layer at the sea floor. The salinity of formation water provides important constraints on fluid flow in sedimentary basins. In the North Sea Basin and the Gulf Coast Basin, these types of data indicate that vertical mixing by compaction-driven flow and convection is limited. Compaction-driven flow obeys Darcy's Law but there are complex interdependencies between pressure, permeability and compaction. Given the low compressibility of water, the flow which can result from pressure release alone is very limited, except on a local scale along permeable faults and fractures. The main flow of pore water during burial is driven by compaction, which is a slow process, even when overpressure is released abruptly with a resulting increase in the net effective stress. In the case of high permeability faults, the flow into the fault from low permeability sedimentary rocks at depth may be rate-limiting. The displacement of pore water in adjacent sediments near the top of the faults may also slow down fluid flow on fractures that do not reach the sea floor. Modelling of fluid flow in sedimentary basins should be based on permeability distributions which are mostly determined by primary facies, diagenesis and the tectonic history of the basin. Extensional tectonics produce a predominantly vertical fracture network which may serve as conduits for pore water flowing deep into the crust. Upward flow of hot fluids in basement fractures must have a high velocity in order to produce large thermal anomalies. Concentrations of dissolved components precipitate at the surface and form deposits of quartz and ore minerals. If basement fractures are overlain by a thick sequence of soft sediments, the rate of flow on the fractures will be reduced because of the low permeability in the sedimentary cover, and conductive heat transport will dominate. Flow of water at high enough velocities to bring hot water to the surface and produce hot springs is most likely to occur in fractured basements rocks or well-cemented sedimentary rocks. Concentrated precipitation of dissolved components will occur near the surface, where the rate of cooling is highest. Also, sediment-hosted ores precipitated from flow of hot water on fractures are therefore likely to form before accumulation of thick overlying sedimentary sequences.},

	abstract = {A quantitative understanding of sources and sinks of fixed nitrogen in low-oxygen waters is required to explain the role of oxygen-minimum zones (OMZs) in controlling the fixed nitrogen inventory of the global ocean. Apparent imbalances in geochemical nitrogen budgets have spurred numerous studies to measure the contributions of heterotrophic and autotrophic N2-producing metabolisms (denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation, respectively). Recently, /`cryptic/' sulphur cycling was proposed as a partial solution to the fundamental biogeochemical problem of closing marine fixed-nitrogen budgets in intensely oxygen-deficient regions. The degree to which the cryptic sulphur cycle can fuel a loss of fixed nitrogen in the modern ocean requires the quantification of sulphur recycling in OMZ settings. Here we provide a new constraint for OMZ sulphate reduction based on isotopic profiles of oxygen (18O/16O) and sulphur (33S/32S, 34S/32S) in seawater sulphate through oxygenated open-ocean and OMZ-bearing water columns. When coupled with observations and models of sulphate isotope dynamics and data-constrained model estimates of OMZ water-mass residence time, we find that previous estimates for sulphur-driven remineralization and loss of fixed nitrogen from the oceans are near the upper limit for what is possible given in situ sulphate isotope data.},

	abstract = {The biogeochemical cycling of sulfur is one of the primary processes that regulate the Earth's surface redox conditions. In this study, we examine the abundance and sulfur isotopic composition (δ34S) of
pyrite through a series of cores collected from different water depths from the Gulf of Papua, Papua New Guinea. Physically undisturbed cores from deep water (depths up to 50 m) show relatively smooth δ34Spyr profiles with small scatter between adjacent samples within a core. In these cores, δ34Spyr gets gradually enriched from {\textasciitilde} -32‰ in
the upper section to {\textasciitilde} -25‰ in the lower section. On the other
hand, the δ34Spyr profiles in cores from shallow water depths (8 - 18 m) present larger scatter (up to 35‰) and unusually enriched
δ34Spyr values (up to +36‰) are observed. These disparate
results can be understood by combining a Rayleigh distillation model to explain elevated 34S values under closed-system conditions, together with the impact of episodic reworking of sediments, which enhances the stratigraphic variability of sulfide isotopic signals. Such different δ34Spyr patterns (both in their mean values and the degree of
variability) between shallow water and deep water depositional
environments, if preserved in the geologic record, could result in disparate interpretations. Understanding how modern depositional and diagenetic environments impact sulfur cycling processes gives us new insights when interpreting ancient sulfur isotope records.},

Darwin observed that worms aerate and mix soils on a massive scale, aiding in the decomposition of soil organic matter. A similar statement can be made about marine benthic animals. This mixing, also known as bioturbation, not only aides in the decomposition of sedimentary organic material, but as contended here, it has also significantly influenced the chemistry of seawater. In particular, it is proposed that sediment mixing by bioturbating organisms resulted in a severalfold increase in seawater sulfate concentration. For this reason, the evolution of bioturbation is linked to the significant deposition of sulfate evaporate minerals, which is largely a phenomena of the Phanerozoic, the last 542 million years and the time over which animals rose to prominence.},

The samples analyzed were from three formations in the Late Silurian Michigan Basin, the A-1, A-2, and B Evaporites of the Salina Group, and one formation in the Early Silurian Canning Basin (Australia), the Mallowa Salt of the Carribuddy Group. The results indicate that the major-ion composition of Silurian seawater was not the same as present-day seawater. The Silurian ocean had lower concentrations of Mg2+, Na+, and SO42−, and much higher concentrations of Ca2+ relative to the ocean’s present-day composition. Furthermore, Silurian seawater had Ca2+ in excess of SO42−. Evaporation of Silurian seawater of the composition determined in this study produces KCl-type potash minerals that lack the MgSO4-type late stage salts formed during the evaporation of present-day seawater. The relatively low Na+ concentrations in Silurian seawater support the hypothesis that oscillations in the major-ion composition of the oceans are primarily controlled by changes in the flux of mid-ocean ridge brine and riverine inputs and not global or basin-scale, seawater-driven dolomitization. The Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio of Silurian seawater was ∼1.4, and the K+/Ca2+ ratio was ∼0.3, both of which differ from the present-day counterparts of 5 and 1, respectively. Seawaters with Mg2+/Ca2+ \&lt;2 facilitate the precipitation of low-magnesian calcite (mol \% Mg \&lt; 4) marine ooids and submarine carbonate cements whereas seawaters with Mg2+/Ca2+ \&gt;2 (e.g., modern seawater) facilitate the precipitation of aragonite and high-magnesian calcite. Therefore, the early Paleozoic calcite seas were likely due to the low Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio of seawater, not the pCO2 of the Silurian atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The major-ion (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, SO42−, and Cl−) composition of Permian seawater was determined from chemical analyses of fluid inclusions in marine halites. New data from the Upper Permian San Andres Formation of Texas (274–272 Ma) and Salado Formation of New Mexico (251 Ma), analyzed by the environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) X-ray energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) method, along with published chemical compositions of fluid inclusions in Permian marine halites from North America (two formations of different ages) and the Central and Eastern European basins (eight formations of four different ages) show that Permian seawater shares chemical characteristics with modern seawater, including SO42− \&gt; Ca2+ at the point of gypsum precipitation, evolution into Mg2+-Na+-K+-SO42−-Cl− brines, and Mg2+/K+ ratios ∼5. Permian seawater, however, is slightly depleted in SO42− and enriched in Ca2+, although modeling results do not rule out Ca2+ concentrations close to those in present-day seawater. Na+ and Mg2+ in Permian seawater are close to (slightly below) their concentrations in modern seawater. Permian and modern seawater are both classified as aragonite seas, with Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios \&gt;2, conditions favorable for precipitation of aragonite and magnesian calcite as ooids and cements.

The chemistry of Permian seawater was modeled using the chemical composition of brine inclusions for three periods: Lower Permian Asselian-Sakmarian (296–283 Ma), Lower Permian Artinskian-Kungurian (283–274 Ma), and Upper Permian Tatarian (258–251 Ma). Parallel changes in the chemistry of brine inclusions from equivalent age evaporites in North America, Central Europe, and Eastern Europe show that seawater underwent secular variations in chemistry over the 50 million years of the Permian. Modeled SO42− concentrations are 20 mmol per kg H2O (mmolal) and 19 mmolal in the Asselian-Sakmarian and Artinskian-Kungurian, with higher concentrations in the Upper Permian Tatarian (23 mmolal). Modeled Ca2+ is at or above its concentration in modern seawater throughout the Permian. Mg2+ is close to (slightly below) its concentration in modern seawater (55 mmolal) in the Asselian-Sakmarian (52 mmolal), and Tatarian (52 mmolal), but slightly higher than modern seawater in the Artinskian-Kungurian (60 mmolal). Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios are 3.5 (total range = 2.7 to 5.5) in the Lower Permian and rose slightly to 3.7 (total range = 3.1 to 5.8) in the Upper Permian, primarily due to decreases in Ca2+. These results are consistent with models that predict oscillations in the major-ion composition of Phanerozoic seawater on the basis of changes in the midocean ridge/river water flux ratio driven by changes in the rate of midocean ridge crust production.

The Permian was characterized by low sea levels, icehouse conditions, and southern hemisphere glaciation. Such conditions, analogous to the present ice age, and the similarities between Permian seawater and modern seawater, all suggest that general Phanerozoic supercycles, driven by mantle convection and global volcanicity, also control the major-ion chemistry of seawater.},

These ages confirm that there were two major phases of volcanic activity in the English Midlands and Wales, one about 620–590 Ma and another about 575–550 Ma. This was followed in most of England and Wales by a major phase of tectonism before the Cambrian (Tommotian) transgression across the Midland Platform. Within the depocentre of the Welsh early Palaeozoic basin, however, sedimentation started within the second period of volcanism and may have continued without interruption well into the Cambrian Period. It is probable that the late phases of the Avalonian Orogeny lasted until after the beginning of the Cambrian. These new data show that the terranes of the Avalonian of England and Wales are comparable with those of eastern Canada and New England. The age estimate for the Charnia horizon is broadly similar to those obtained elsewhere in the world on rocks containing the earliest Ediacaran fauna and adds to the building of an extended time-scale for the global Ediacaran.},

	abstract = {The distribution and community ecology of Early Pennsylvanian (middle Bashkirian, Langsettian) vegetation on a seasonally dry fluvial megafan is reconstructed from plant assemblages in the Tynemouth Creek Formation of New Brunswick, Canada. The principal motif of the redbed-dominated succession consists of degraded interfluve surfaces overlain by coarsening-upward aggradational sequences, a pattern that expresses the approach of an active channel system over a part of the megafan where landscape stasis prevailed. Accrual under a (dry) subhumid tropical climate, typified by a protracted dry season and a short wet season with torrential rainfall, resulted in Vertisol-like paleosols, episodic discharge and sedimentation, shallow channels incised into partially indurated interfluve strata, and scattered ‘waterhole’ deposits. Plant fossils, including many upright stumps, are preferentially preserved above paleosol-mantled interfluve surfaces, recording the inundation of a vegetated landscape. Quantitative analysis of 41 census-sampled megafloral assemblages collected in facies context indicates that a cordaitalean-rich flora dominated the dryland ecosystem. Less common was a wetland flora typical of tropical lowlands at coeval localities, comprising medullosalean pteridosperms and calamitaleans with rare ferns and lycopsids. ‘Enigmatic dryland’ plants, taxa of ambiguous affinity including Megalopteris, Pseudadiantites, and Palaeopteridium, were rare but surprisingly diverse. The taphonomic and sedimentologic context of fossiliferous horizons indicates that low-diversity, old-growth stands of gigantic cordaitaleans blanketed distal interfluves and inactive parts of the megafan, environs marked by limited deposition and extended paleosol development. Small patches of the pteridosperm-dominated wetland flora were interspersed within the dense cordaitalean forest, restricted to landforms that acted as waterholes during the dry season, such as perennial lakes, stagnant ponds, and seasonally active interfluve channels. In contrast, cordaitaleans and wetland plants formed mixed communities in disturbance-prone proximal interfluves and fluvial tracts, where more flooding and sedimentation resulted in less moisture-stressed conditions and a wider range of habitable landforms. Dense calamitalean groves persisted alongside fluvial channels, and an array of wetland plants occupied seasonally active abandoned channels that retained water throughout the year (waterholes). Rare ‘enigmatic dryland’ species were more prevalent in flood-prone fluvial tracts, and were dispersed within cordaitalean-dominated and wetland communities rather than forming discrete, compositionally unique patches. Although frequently characterized as ‘extrabasinal’ or ‘upland’ elements, this study confirms that these unusual plants occupied Pennsylvanian tropical lowlands during episodes of climatic drying.},

	abstract = {The Baraboo Quartzite and overlying metasediments in south-central Wisconsin long were assumed correlative with middle Precambrian Huronian and/or Animikean strata of the Lake Superior region-that is, presumably between 1,800 and 2,600 m.y. old. Like Animikie rocks in northern Wisconsin and Michigan, the pure quartzite at Baraboo is overlain by dolomite, banded iron "formation," and slate. But rhyolitic tuff breccias and welded tuffs that stratigraphically underlie the Baraboo metasediments have yielded a Rb-Sr whole-rock isochron date of \$1,640 {\textbackslash}pm 40 m.y. ({\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}beta = 1.39 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} years{\textasciicircum}\{-1\})\$ with an initial \$Sr{\textasciicircum}\{87\}/Sr{\textasciicircum}\{86\}\$ ratio of \$0.7048 {\textbackslash}pm 0.0064\$. Previous isotopic dating indicates that similar quartzite at nearby Waterloo, Wisconsin can be no younger than 1,410-1,440 m.y.; this appears to be a younger limit for all of the Baraboo-type sediments. If the Rb-Sr isochron age is interpreted as approximately the time of eruption of the rhyolites, then overlying Baraboo metasediments would be of late Precambrian rather than middle Precambrian age as currently defined in the region. Rocks in the Baraboo region and in many other areas of central Wisconsin were deformed and metamorphosed during some event in the interval 1,300-1,500 m.y. ago, which seems to have had widespread effects in the central United States. If, as considerable circumstantial evidence indicates, the Sioux, Barron, and Bessemer Quartzites occurring to the west and north are equivalent to the Baraboo, then a region of thick quartz sand sedimentation extended at least from present Lake Michigan to western South Dakota about 1,500-1,600 m.y. ago. The sediments suggest accumulation on a subsiding shallow-water shelf, but it is not clear whether that shelf marked the southern margin of an embryonic North American continent or lay within some intracontinental belt.},

The Rapitan Group ranges in thickness from c. 50 to 700 m with Fe-formation common in the upper 10 m. In the most distal settings, the Rapitan Group is separated from the diamictite of the Hay Creek Group by over 100 m of sandstone and siltstone; however, the Hay Creek Group contains large erosive surfaces and cannibalizing breccia, and rarely preserves strata between the two glaciogenic deposits. The diamictite of the Hay Creek Group is capped by a white- to buff-coloured dolostone with pseudo-teepee structures, bed-parallel, isopachous sheet-crack cements, and a depleted C-isotope signature. Late Neoproterozoic glacial deposits in the Tatonduk inlier were formerly assigned to the Tindir Group. To simplify the nomenclature in the northwestern Canadian Cordillera, the Tindir Group was abandoned and replaced with nomenclature consistent with that of the Windermere Supergroup in the Mackenzie Mountains. The mixed lithology and anchizone-grade metamorphism distinguish the Rapitan and Hay Creek Groups in the Tatonduk inlier as attractive future targets for integrated micropalaeontology, geochemistry, palaeomagnetism and geochronology.},

Draken Conglomerate of Ny Friesland, Spitsbergen, contains abundant, well preserved microfossils in silicified shards of microbial mats, as well as in associated silicified clasts of non-stromatolitic mud. Sedimentation apparently took place in a lagoonal environment subjected to occasional storms. Within one local area, three distinct microbial mat associations can be recognized, each dominated by a single filamentous cyanobacterial mat builder occurring in densely interwoven patterns oriented parallel to bedding. One mat association often contains an associate mat building filament, and two of the three associations harbor mat-specific stromatolite dwelling blue-greens. Three taxa, all probable cyanobacteria, apparently lived as microbenthos in the non-stromatolitic mud. Approximately a dozen planktonic taxa have been recognized in this microbiota; these occur as randomly scattered individuals and clusters in all three mat associations and in the carbonate mud. The Draken microbiota provides a case study of the ecological heterogeity and microbial distribution within a single late Precambrian environment, and suggests the importance of paleoecology in analyses of Proterozoic evolution and biostratigraphy. Twenty-eight taxa are recognized of which eight are formally described as new: Salome svalbardensis n. gen. et sp., Synodophycus euthemos n. gen. et sp., Sphaerophycus wilsonii n. sp., Eosynechococcus brevis n. sp., Eosynechococcus depressus n. sp., Gloediniopsis mikros n. sp., Myxococcoides cantabrigiensis n. sp., and Myxococcoides ovata n. sp.},

	abstract = {Progressive oxygenation of the Earth's early biosphere is thought to have resulted in increased sulphide oxidation during continental weathering, leading to a corresponding increase in marine sulphate concentration. Accurate reconstruction of marine sulphate reservoir size is therefore important for interpreting the oxygenation history of early Earth environments. Few data, however, specifically constrain how sulphate concentrations may have changed during the Proterozoic era (2.5–0.54 Gyr ago). Prior to 2.2 Gyr ago, when oxygen began to accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere, sulphate concentrations are inferred to have been {\textless}1 mM and possibly {\textless}200 M, on the basis of limited isotopic variability preserved in sedimentary sulphides and experimental data showing suppressed isotopic fractionation at extremely low sulphate concentrations. By 0.8 Gyr ago, oxygen and thus sulphate levels may have risen significantly. Here we report large stratigraphic variations in the sulphur isotope composition of marine carbonate-associated sulphate, and use a rate-dependent model for sulphur isotope change that allows us to track changes in marine sulphate concentrations throughout the Proterozoic. Our calculations indicate sulphate levels between 1.5 and 4.5 mM, or 5–15 per cent of modern values, for more than 1 Gyr after initial oxygenation of the Earth's biosphere. Persistence of low oceanic sulphate demonstrates the protracted nature of Earth's oxygenation. It links biospheric evolution to temporal patterns in the depositional behaviour of marine iron- and sulphur-bearing minerals, biological cycling of redox-sensitive elements and availability of trace metals essential to eukaryotic development.},

	abstract = {Carbonate Associated Sulfate (CAS) is trace sulfate incorporated into carbonate minerals during their precipitation. Its sulfur isotopic composition is often assumed to track that of seawater sulfate and inform global carbon and oxygen budgets through Earth's history. However, many CAS sulfur isotope records based on bulk-rock samples are noisy. To determine the source of bulk-rock CAS variability, we extracted CAS from different internal sedimentary components micro-drilled from well-preserved Late Ordovician and early Silurian-age limestones from Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. Mixtures of these components, whose sulfur isotopic compositions vary by nearly 25‰, can explain the bulk-rock CAS range. Large isotopic variability of sedimentary micrite CAS (34S-depleted from seawater by up to 15‰) is consistent with pore fluid sulfide oxidation during early diagenesis. Specimens recrystallized during burial diagenesis have CAS 34S-enriched by up to 9‰ from Hirnantian seawater, consistent with microbial sulfate reduction in a confined aquifer. In contrast to the other variable components, brachiopods with well-preserved secondary-layer fibrous calcite—a phase independently known to be the best-preserved sedimentary component in these strata—have a more homogeneous isotopic composition. These specimens indicate that seawater sulfate remained close to about 25‰ (V-CDT) through Hirnantian (end-Ordovician) events, including glaciation, mass extinction, carbon isotope excursion, and pyrite-sulfur isotope excursion. The textural relationships between our samples and their CAS isotope ratios highlight the role of diagenetic biogeochemical processes in setting the isotopic composition of CAS.},

	abstract = {Carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) has the potential to generate high-resolution records of seawater sulfate (δ34SSW) that improve upon existing evaporite-based records. With improved resolution, however, significant isotopic offsets have become apparent between the evaporite and CAS proxies. Here we present high-resolution δ34S measurements of both these proxies from the Ara Group, Sultanate of Oman, a series of six carbonate-evaporite sequences deposited ca. 547–540 Ma. The δ34SCAS from Ara carbonates show little scatter and provide our estimate of δ34SSW. Repeated enrichments (as much as 4‰ relative to δ34SCAS) were observed in floor and roof anhydrite units (δ34SEVAP) bounding the Ara carbonates. These enrichments cannot be explained by secular variation or from isotopic fractionation during evaporite deposition and require the existence of an additional 34S-depleted sink, which we attribute to H2S production via ongoing bacterial sulfate reduction during evaporite deposition. To preserve this isotope signature, the resulting sulfide must be sequestered as pyrite. The magnitude of the resulting δ34SEVAP offset (relative to CAS) is a function of local pyrite burial (fpyr). In periods of low pyrite burial, it is possible for δ34SEVAP to be depleted relative to δ34SSW, whereas during episodes of substantial pyrite burial (fpyr {\textgreater} 0.05), δ34SEVAP can be strongly enriched relative to δ34SSW. Our data suggest that local fpyr of ∼0.13 is consistent with the observed δ34SEVAP enrichments found in the Ara Group anhydrites. Such elevated pyrite burial in evaporitic settings requires a substantial iron source, supporting possible ferruginous ocean conditions across the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary. Isotopic offsets between paired δ34SCAS-δ34Sanhydrite data may thus serve as an independent proxy for marine redox through time, in addition to quantifying the importance of microbial activity in a setting where direct evidence (e.g., total organic carbon or biomarkers) may be scarce and physical processes are thought to dominate.},

Features preserved on the top surfaces of fine- to medium-grained sandstone beds in a number of stratigraphically and geographically separated localities are attributable to microbially induced sedimentary structures; these include wrinkle structures, remnants of apparent microbial crusts, and indications of original cohesiveness and pliancy in sand-sized sediment. The surfaces on which the microbial structures formed were exposed subaerially (abundant, deep desiccation cracks and locally pedogenic structures) in alluvial, interfluve, and lacustrine margin settings, and many of the structures developed in areas well away from the perennially wetted regions adjacent to shorelines and fluvial channels. Thus, these features indicate that Earth's biosphere had adapted to and colonized land surfaces many hundreds of millions of years before the dawn of the Phanerozoic.},

	abstract = {Isotopic data are used to determine a new chronology for the Torridonian of NW Scotland. The calcite fraction of the Stoer Group Limestone Member yields a Pb–Pb age of 1199 ± 70 (2σ) Ma (MSWD = 1.1). Rb–Sr whole-rock regressions from siltstones of the Diabaig and Applecross Formations (both Torridon Group) produce ages of 994 ± 48 (2σ) Ma (MSWD = 17) and 977 ± 39 (2σ) Ma (MSWD = 10) respectively. These dates, which agree well with palaeomagnetic estimates, are interpreted as the time of early diagenesis which is probably within error of the time of deposition. Previous isotopic age determinations are shown to be in error.
Size fractionsfrom shales of the Stoer Group and Applecross Formation have been analysed for Rb–Sr and produce ages of 689 ± 87 (2 σ) Ma (MSWD = 14) and 667 ± 66 (2 σ) Ma (MSWD = 55) respectively. They are used, together with Sm-Nd isotopic data, to suggest a thermal event affecting the entire Torridonian at this time.
Our new chronology for the Torridonian is consistent with the Proterozoic geology of Scotland and Laurentia. It suggests that deposition of the Stoer Group is contemporaneous with uplift of the Lewisian and the Torridon Group may be associated with the extensional collapse of the Grenville orogen. The c. 700Ma diagenetic event is possibly related to Neoproterozoic rifting of the Laurentian margin.},

	abstract = {Many aspects of Earth’s early sulfur cycle, from the origin of mass-anomalous fractionations to the degree of biological participation, remain poorly understood—in part due to complications from postdepositional diagenetic and metamorphic processes. Using a combination of scanning high-resolution magnetic superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of sulfur isotopes (32S, 33S, and 34S), we examined drill core samples from slope and basinal environments adjacent to a major Late Archean (∼2.6–2.5 Ga) marine carbonate platform from South Africa. Coupled with petrography, these techniques can untangle the complex history of mineralization in samples containing diverse sulfur-bearing phases. We focused on pyrite nodules, precipitated in shallow sediments. These textures record systematic spatial differences in both mass-dependent and mass-anomalous sulfur-isotopic composition over length scales of even a few hundred microns. Petrography and magnetic imaging demonstrate that mass-anomalous fractionations were acquired before burial and compaction, but also show evidence of postdepositional alteration 500 million y after deposition. Using magnetic imaging to screen for primary phases, we observed large spatial gradients in Δ33S ({\textgreater}4‰) in nodules, pointing to substantial environmental heterogeneity and dynamic mixing of sulfur pools on geologically rapid timescales. In other nodules, large systematic radial δ34S gradients ({\textgreater}20‰) were observed, from low values near their centers increasing to high values near their rims. These fractionations support hypotheses that microbial sulfate reduction was an important metabolism in organic-rich Archean environments—even in an Archean ocean basin dominated by iron chemistry.},

Field sedimentological investigations, combined with laboratory analysis of bedding planes and petrographic study of thin sections have allowed us to characterise a range of depositional environments and document the spectrum of biological structures. MISS are reported from frequently subaerial environments, through commonly submerged facies, and down to permanently sub-wavebase settings. Palaeoenvironmental conditions (water depth, exposure, hydrodynamic energy) control the distribution of MISS within these facies. This demonstrates that mat-forming microbial communities were arguably well adapted to low light levels or periodic exposure. Some MISS from the Diabaig Formation are typical of Precambrian microbial mats, including reticulate fabrics and ‘old elephant skin’ textures. In addition to these, a number of new and unusual fabrics of putative microbial origin are described, including linear arrays of ridges and grooves (cf. ‘Arumberia’) and discoidal structures that are comparable with younger Ediacaran fossils such as Beltanelliformis. These observations indicate that benthic microbial ecosystems were thriving in freshwater lake systems {\textasciitilde} 1000 Ma, and indicate how microbially induced sedimentary structures may be applied as facies indicators for Proterozoic lacustrine environments. The discovery of structures closely resembling Ediacaran fossils (cf. Beltanelliformis) also serves to highlight the difficulty of interpreting simple discoidal bedding plane structures as metazoan fossils.},

There are two competing, but non-mutually exclusive, hypotheses: (1) similarities reflect a sampling bias imposed by variable and incomplete sampling of fossils, and (2) similarities reflect environmental perturbations that influence both the patterns of sedimentation and macroevolution (i.e., common-cause). Macrostratigraphy, which is based on the quantitative analysis of hiatus-bound rock packages, permits variation in the rock record to be expressed in terms of rock quantity and, more importantly, spatiotemporal continuity. In combination with spatially-explicit fossil occurrence data in the Paleobiology Database, it is now possible to more rigorously test alternative hypotheses for similarities in the rock and fossil records and to start distinguishing between geologically-controlled sampling bias and the common-cause hypothesis. Here we summarize results from measuring the intersection of Macrostrat and the Paleobiology Database. Our results suggest that patterns in the fossil record are not dominated by large-scale stratigraphic biases. Instead, they suggest that linkages between multiple Earth systems are driving both spatiotemporal patterns of sedimentation and macroevolution.},

Although environmental perturbations of many different kinds are known to have affected long-term biological evolution, particularly during major mass extinction events, the relative importance of physical environmental factors versus biological interactions in governing rates of extinction and origination through geological time remains unknown. Here we use macrostratigraphic data from the Atlantic Ocean basin to show that changes in global species diversity and rates of extinction among planktonic foraminifera have been linked to tectonically and climatically forced changes in ocean circulation and chemistry from the Jurassic period to the present. Transient environmental perturbations, such as those that occurred after the asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous period approximately 66 million years ago, and the Eocene/Oligocene greenhouse–icehouse transition approximately 34 million years ago, are superimposed on this general long-term relationship. Rates of species origination, by contrast, are not correlated with corresponding macrostratigraphic quantities, indicating that physiochemical changes in the ocean–atmosphere system affect evolution principally by driving the synchronous extinction of lineages that originated owing to more protracted and complex interactions between biological and environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Students of Earth history have long recognized the correlation between the quantity of preserved sedimentary rock and the diversity of life recorded as fossils. But paleontologists have yet to determine whether this pattern reflects a causal relationship or a unidirectional sampling bias in fossil data imposed by preserved rock quantity. Distinguishing between these two alternatives has been complicated by the fact that many of the basic patterns of paleontologic and lithologic covariation have yet to be quantified rigorously. Here we present the first analyses of the covariation between the macrostratigraphic and macroevolutionary histories of North America based on geographically and temporally explicit co-occurrences of rocks and fossils. The analyses use independent quantitative summaries of the stratigraphic and fossil records by integrating the Paleobiology Database (PaleoDB) and Macrostrat, a macrostratigraphy database for North America, which allows a more direct comparison of the stratigraphic and biological histories of the continent than has heretofore been possible. Within the Macrostrat database, the rock record is divided into discrete packages of sediment that are bound by hiatuses resolvable at the stage-level. Using per interval, per package rates of sediment package initiation and truncation, and genus first and last appearances (herein regional origination and extinction), we find a substantially stronger positive correlation between sediments and biology for extinction-like parameters than we do for origination-like parameters. Four of the largest coincident pulses of regional extinction and sediment truncation occur during the widely recognized end-Ordovician, late Permian, end-Triassic, and end-Cretaceous mass extinction intervals. A further comparison of the global ranges of North American genera to North American macrostratigraphy indicates that the regional and global extinction of genera are more likely to occur in the same stage than are global and regional originations. Together, these results suggest that our general understanding of biodiversity dynamics from the fossil record may not be strongly biased by the preservation of sediments and leaves open the possibility that certain large perturbations to the Earth system are responsible for major changes of state in both the sedimentary and biological systems.},

Although the use of this pole as a key pole cannot be justified because the age of the Tumblagooda Sandstone is not reliably known, comparison of this pole with a Siluro‐Devonian pole from eastern Australia, and Ordovician to Silurian poles from Africa (in an appropriate pre‐breakup reference frame), suggests an age of Ordovician. Palaeontological evidence from large eurypterid tracks suggests a Silurian to Devonian age. While stratigraphic evidence is meagre, isotopic data have been used to support a post‐Early Silurian age.

	abstract = {The trace fossils of the Tumblagooda Sandstone (?late Silurian) of Kalbarri, Western Australia are spectacular in their variety and preservation. They provide a unique insight into the activities of the early invaders of terrestrial environments, and reveal the presence of a diverse fauna dominated by arthropods. Within the Formation trace fossil assemblages can be related to fluvial, aeolian and marine sand-dominated environments. Two distinct and diverse ichnofaunas are recognised.

The Heimdallia–Diplichnites Ichnofauna occurs in sandstones deposited in broad low sinuosity braided fluvial channels, between which were mixed aeolian and waterlain sandsheets, small aeolian dunes and flooded interdune and deflation hollows. Heimdallia is the major bioturbator, favouring shallow pools. Other burrows include Tumblagoodichnus (gen. nov.), Diplocraterion, Skolithos, Beaconites and Didymaulyponomos. Arthropod trackways (Diplichnites) occur on surfaces of waterlain sands and on foreset bedding of aeolian dunes, and represent some of the earliest reported terrestrial trackways. Other trackways include Paleohelcura and Protichnites, and the digging traces Selenichnites and Rusophycus are also present. At least ten types of arthropods are required to produce the observed traces. Myriapods, eurypterids, euthycarcinoids, xiphosurids and scorpionids are considered responsible for the trackway assemblage.

The Skolithos–Diplocraterion Ichnofauna occurs at the top of the exposed section in sandstones that overlie a thick fluvial sequence containing few traces. The strata are considered to represent marine influence at a fluvial/marine transition. They show variable trough cross-bedding, complex planar cross-bedding with down-climbing sets, ripple lamination, and fining-up sequences with bioturbated tops. Traces are dominated by crowded Skolithos up to 1 m long, together with two forms of Diplocraterion. Daedalus and Lunatubichnus (gen. nov.) burrows occur in a few beds and Aulichnites trails cover some foreset surfaces of cross-bedding.

The trace fossils and the sedimentology of the Tumblagooda Sandstone bear a remarkable similarity to those of the lower part of the Taylor Group of Antarctica, which is probably Devonian in age. It is suggested that the two represent a similar age, stratigraphy, and range of environments on the margins of Gondwana. Large unvegetated fluvial outwash plains with variable aeolian influence were essentially coastal in character and fluvial/marine transitions occur in sand-rich environments. The animals responsible for the traces inhabited coastal areas but many could survive outwith marine influence, and arthropods responsible for some types of Diplichnites trackways walked out of water.

The rich diversity of trackways attributable to arthropods illustrate that the invasion of terrestrial environments by arthropods, particularly large forms, was well-established by the beginning of the Devonian. The basis of the food chain was algal and bacterial films which bound the surface sediment in freshwater pools.},

	abstract = {Despite nearly a century of study by a diverse group of Precambrian workers, competing interpretations have persisted that favor both marine and nonmarine depositional settings for the Mesoproterozoic Belt Supergroup of the northwestern United States. Our data for sedimentary pyrite formation in unmetamorphosed organic-rich shales of the Newland Formation of the lower Belt Supergroup, western Montana, argue that at least a portion of the Belt basin, during its early history, was characterized by restricted marine conditions with only episodic incursions of seawater. This model is supported by ratios of organic carbon (Corg) to pyrite sulfur that, once corrected for selective diagenetic and thermal loss of Corg and the inferred high reactivity of the Corg reservoir in the absence of vascular land-plant remains, suggest degrees of sulfate limitation consistent with a restricted marine setting. The isotopically heavy disseminated pyrite that dominates the black shales shows a broad range of δ34S values of bacterial origin (δ34S ranges from −8.7 to +36.3‰; mean = +7.6‰, n = 41). The pyrite data overlap with the δ34S range of coeval (barite) sulfate within the basin and are similar to independent estimates for the sulfate of Mesoproterozoic seawater. These relationships have allowed us to delineate a record of bacteriogenic pyrite that formed in a modified marine reservoir where the supply of sulfate was limited. A bacterial mechanism is further suggested by the morphological character of this early-formed pyrite, including the ubiquitous framboids. After comparing our results with those from present-day localities, such as the Black Sea and sites of lacustrine deposition, we conclude that the abundant 34S-enriched bacteriogenic disseminated pyrite observed in black shales of the Newland Formation must record a style of sulfate limitation possible only within an isolated marine basin receiving an intermittent flux of seawater. Although the entire Belt basin likely remained a restricted marine setting throughout deposition of the lower Belt Supergroup, sulfur isotope data from the Newland Formation at two localities separated by more than 150 km in the eastern Belt basin reveal stratigraphic trends in the strength of the marine connection. Specifically, the connection evolved such that inputs of seawater sulfate increased progressively in frequency and possibly strength during deposition of the Newland Formation. Overall, the hypothesized restricted marine setting, when viewed in light of independent tectonic, sedimentologic and geochronologic evidence, suggests syndepositional and likely episodic continental rifting, which helps constrain the Proterozoic paleotectonic history of western Laurentia.},

	abstract = {The main terminal processes of organic matter mineralization in anoxic Black Sea sediments underlying the sulfidic water column are sulfate reduction in the upper 2–4 m and methanogenesis below the sulfate zone. The modern marine deposits comprise a ca. 1-m-deep layer of coccolith ooze and underlying sapropel, below which sea water ions penetrate deep down into the limnic Pleistocene deposits from \&gt;9000 years BP. Sulfate reduction rates have a subsurface maximum at the SO42−-CH4 transition where H2S reaches maximum concentration. Because of an excess of reactive iron in the deep limnic deposits, most of the methane-derived H2S is drawn downward to a sulfidization front where it reacts with Fe(III) and with Fe2+ diffusing up from below. The H2S-Fe2+ transition is marked by a black band of amorphous iron sulfide above which distinct horizons of greigite and pyrite formation occur. The pore water gradients respond dynamically to environmental changes in the Black Sea with relatively short time constants of ca. 500 yr for SO42− and 10 yr for H2S, whereas the FeS in the black band has taken ca. 3000 yr to accumulate. The dual diffusion interfaces of SO42−-CH4 and H2S-Fe2+ cause the trapping of isotopically heavy iron sulfide with δ34S = +15 to +33‰ at the sulfidization front. A diffusion model for sulfur isotopes shows that the SO42− diffusing downward into the SO42−-CH4 transition has an isotopic composition of +19‰, close to the +23‰ of H2S diffusing upward. These isotopic compositions are, however, very different from the porewater SO42− (+43‰) and H2S (−15‰) at the same depth. The model explains how methane-driven sulfate reduction combined with a deep H2S sink leads to isotopically heavy pyrite in a sediment open to diffusion. These results have general implications for the marine sulfur cycle and for the interpretation of sulfur isotopic data in modern sediments and in sedimentary rocks throughout earth’s history.},

	abstract = {Sulfate reduction and sulfur–iron geochemistry were studied in 5–6 m deep gravity cores of Holocene mud from Aarhus Bay (Denmark). A goal was to understand whether sulfate is generated by re-oxidation of sulfide throughout the sulfate and methane zones, which might explain the abundance of active sulfate reducers deep below the main sulfate zone. Sulfate penetrated down to 130 cm where methane started to build up and where the concentration of free sulfide peaked at 5.5 mM. Below this sulfate–methane transition, sulfide diffused downwards to a sulfidization front at 520 cm depth, below which dissolved iron, Fe2+, accumulated in the pore water. Sulfate reduction rates measured by 35S-tracer incubations in the sulfate zone were high due to high concentrations of reactive organic matter. Within the sulfate–methane transition, sulfate reduction was distinctly stimulated by the anaerobic oxidation of methane. In the methane zone below, sulfate remained at positive “background” concentrations of \&lt;0.5 mM down to the sulfidization front. Sulfate reduction decreased steeply to rates which at 300–500 cm depth were 0.2–1 pmol SO42− cm−3 d−1, i.e., 4–5 orders of magnitude lower than rates measured near the sediment surface. The turn-over time of sulfate increased from 3 years at 12 cm depth to 100–1000 years down in the methane zone. Sulfate reduction in the methane zone accounted for only 0.1\% of sulfate reduction in the entire sediment column and was apparently limited by the low pore water concentration of sulfate and the low availability of organic substrates. Amendment of the sediment with both sulfate and organic substrates immediately caused a 10- to 40-fold higher, “potential sulfate reduction” which showed that a physiologically intact community of sulfate reducing bacteria was present. The “background” sulfate concentration appears to be generated from the reaction of downwards diffusing sulfide with deeply buried Fe(III) species, such as poorly-reactive iron oxides or iron bound in reactive silicates. The oxidation of sulfide to sulfate in the sulfidic sediment may involve the formation of elemental sulfur and thiosulfate and their further disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate. The net reaction of sulfide and Fe(III) to form pyrite requires an additional oxidant, irrespective of the formation of sulfate. This could be CO2 which is reduced with H2 to methane. The methane subsequently diffuses upwards to become re-oxidized at the sulfate–methane transition and thereby removes excess reducing power and enables the formation of excess sulfate. We show here how the combination of these well-established sulfur–iron–carbon reactions may lead to the deep formation of sulfate and drive a cryptic sulfur cycle. The iron-rich post-glacial sediments underlying Holocene marine mud stimulate the strong sub-surface sulfide reoxidation observed in Aarhus Bay and are a result of the glacial to interglacial history of the Baltic Sea area. Yet, processes similar to the ones described here probably occur widespread in marine sediments, in particular along the ocean margins.},

	abstract = {Spider fossils are rare outside of amber but do occur in lacustrine Fossil-Lagerstätten. In general, spiders preserved in lacustrine beds show splayed legs; however, those in the Crato Formation of Brazil are commonly curled up. It is hypothesized that the post-mortem flexure of spider legs is related to the salinity of the lake water. To investigate this, we measured the flexure (at the two main leg joints: femur–patella and tibia–metatarsus) of spider legs in three Fossil-Lagerstätten: the Crato Formation of Brazil (Cretaceous), the Green River Formation of the western USA (Eocene), and the Florissant Formation of Colorado (Eocene). In addition, we drowned living spiders in water of three salinities: fresh (\&lt; 0.5 ppt), saline (35 ppt), and hypersaline (160 ppt). Our results show that spiders drowned in fresh water show predominantly extended legs, those in hypersaline water curled legs, and those in saline water intermediate values of flexure. In the Florissant Formation, spiders show extended legs; in the Crato Formation, the spider legs are predominantly flexed, while those in the Green River Formation show a mixture of flexure types. These results concur with ideas about the salinities of these formations: that the Florissant Formation is a freshwater lake, the Crato Formation represents a hypersaline lake (at least at times), and the Green River lakes varied from fresh to various higher salinities. The reason for this phenomenon is likely that spider legs, uniquely, lack extensor muscles at the femur–patella and tibia–metatarsus joints, relying on hemolymph pressure for leg extension. Hence, post-mortem osmosis determines whether the legs become outstretched (fresh water) or flexed (hypersalinity). While further work is necessary to determine more taphonomic details of this phenomenon, there is sufficient evidence that spider leg flexure may be a useful indicator of salinity in lacustrine paleoenvironments.},

(2010) cast doubts on the terrestrial interpretation of trace-fossil bearing strata of the Ordovician Juniata Formation and thus on their applicability to the study of early terrestrial ecosystems. We do not think that Retallack's (2011) comment on this paper dispels these doubts, for the reasons listed herein. If sedimentary facies analysis were as straightforward as inferred by Retallack (2011) in the first paragraph of his comment, then it would be easy to determine, one way or another, the depositional environment of the sedimentary succession at Potters Mills. Although Retallack (2011) implies that such phenomena as “turbidites, hummocky cross-bedding, and flaser and lenticular bedding” are diagnostic of marine conditions, none of them are (e.g., Greenwood and Sherman, 1986; Martin, 2000). We highlight this misapprehension to emphasize that sedimentary structures generated by hydrodynamic processes are rarely diagnostic of particular environments and must be used to this end with great caution. In the case of the Juniata Formation at Potters Mills, as illustrated by Davies et al. (2010), there are no physical sedimentary structures in the succession that are diagnostic of any specific depositional environment, marine or continental. This observation alone casts doubt on studies that have previously offered firm sedimentological interpretations of the Potters Mills succession. Retallack (2011) is correct to point out that better exposed outcrops of parts of the Juniata Formation have permitted interpretations of deposition within braided fluvial systems (Cotter, 1978), but fluvial deposition does not account for the whole formation (e.g., Thompson, 1970; Driese and Foreman, 1991, 1992; Ettensohn, 2004; Davies et al., 2011).

(2010, abstract) propose that, contrary to past studies, “The evidence suggests that the Juniata Formation at Potters Mills was deposited in a marginal marine setting and, as such, no evidence for early life on land can be inferred from its strata.” The new evidence they present, not only from the Juniata Formation at Potters Mills, but from other localities in Pennsylvania, is a facies analysis and description of sedimentary structures. This is a welcome approach to the problem, because there are distinctive marine sedimentary structures and facies such as turbidites, hummocky cross-bedding, and flaser and lenticular bedding. However, this promising approach failed because neither these nor any diagnostic marine sedimentary structure is described from the Juniata Formation by these or prior authors. The sole plausible exception is a single case of reversing cross stratification at Waggoners Gap, which is inadequately exposed and qualified by Davies et al. (2010) as a possible artifact of outcrop orientation. The sedimentary structures and facies of the Juniata Formation have long been interpreted as formed in braided streams (Cotter, 1978), thus explaining the lack of lateral accretion deposits formed by meandering streams.

“Under other circumstances, particularly given the nondiagnostic nature of the sedimentary facies, it would be standard practice to assume significant marine influence in the Juniata Formation based on the diverse and abundant trace fossils,” write Davies et al. (2010, p. 535), although they make an exception for repichnia (surface tracks and trails). “The lack of evidence for repichnial trackways in the Juniata sets it apart from all other early Paleozoic, terrestrial trace-fossil-bearing successions described to date” (Davies et al., 2010, p. 535). This statement is directly contradicted by their own illustrations of such fossils from the Juniata Formation (Davies et al., 2010, fig. 5N) labeled as “repichnial crossing …},

to the fundamental importance of plant life for the construction of
physical habitats within fluvial environments. Data from an extensive
literature review and original fieldwork demonstrates that many
landforms and geomorphic features of modern river systems appear in the
Palaeozoic stratigraphic record once terrestrial vegetation had adopted
certain evolutionary advances. For example, stable point bars are
associated with the onset of rooted plants in the Siluro-Devonian and
avulsive and anabranching fluvial systems become common at the same time
as extensive arborescent vegetation in the Carboniferous. In this paper,
we demonstrate a correlation between the diversification of physical
fluvial environments and the expansion of terrestrial fauna and flora,

alluvial systems. Many extrinsic factors have been considered as
possible controls on the evolutionary timelines of terrestrialization

terrestrial biodiversity was the variety of physical habitats,
especially riparian systems, available for newly evolved organisms. In

anabranching reaches created further physical landforms for colonization
and would have promoted increasingly complex hyporheic flow regimes.
Furthermore the associated increase in arborescent vegetation and supply
of large woody debris to inland and coastal rivers would have created a
wealth of microhabitats for continental organisms. We argue that the
expanding extent and diversity of physical alluvial niches during the
Palaeozoic is an underappreciated driver of the terrestrialization of
early continental life. The study of the deep-time fossil and
stratigraphic record also illustrates that vegetation is a fundamental
prerequisite for the creation of biogeomorphic alluvial landforms and
physical habitats and microhabitats.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that life originated and diversified in the oceans prior to colonizing the land. However, environmental constraints in chemical evolution models point towards critical steps leading to the origin of life as having occurred in subaerial settings. The earliest fossil record does not include finds from terrestrial deposits, so much of our understanding about the presence of a terrestrial microbial cover prior to the Proterozoic is based on inference and geochemical proxies that indicate biospheric carbon cycling during the Archaean. Our assessment is that by 2.7 Ga, microbial ecosystems in terrestrial settings were driven by oxygen-generating, photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Studies of modern organisms indicate that both the origin and primary diversification of the eukaryotes could have occurred in terrestrial settings, shortly after 2.0 Ga, but there is no direct fossil evidence of terrestrial eukaryotes until about 1.1 Ga. At this time, it appears that the diversity of life in non-marine habitats exceeded that found in marine settings where sulphidic seas may have impaired eukaryotic physiology and retarded evolution. Geochemical proxies indicate the establishment of an extensive soil-forming microbial cover by 850 Ma, and it is possible that a rise in atmospheric oxygen at this time was due to the evolutionary expansion of green algae into terrestrial habitats. Direct fossil evidence of the earliest terrestrial biotas in the Phanerozoic consists of problematical palynomorphs from the Cambro-Ordovician of Laurentia. These indicate that the evolution of the first land plants (embryophytes) during the Middle Ordovician took place within a landscape that included aeroterrestrial algae which were actively adapting to selection in subaerial settings.},

	abstract = {Sedimentary pyrite formation during early diagenesis is a major process for controlling the oxygen level of the atmosphere and the sulfate concentration in seawater over geologic time. The amount of pyrite that may form in a sediment is limited by the rates of supply of decomposable organic matter, dissolved sulfate, and reactive detrital iron minerals. Organic matter appears to be the major control on pyrite formation in normal (non-euxinic) terrigenous marine sediments where dissolved sulfate and iron minerals are abundant. By contrast, pyrite formation in non-marine, freshwater sediments is severely limited by low concentrations of sulfate and this characteristic can be used to distinguish ancient organic-rich fresh water shales from marine shales. Under marine euxinic conditions sufficient H2S is produced that the dominant control on pyrite formation is the availability of reactive iron minerals. Calculations, based on a sulfur isotope model, indicate that over Phanerozoic time the worldwide average organic carbon-to-pyrite sulfur ratio of sedimentary rocks has varied considerably. High CS ratios during Permo-Carboniferous time can be explained by a shift of major organic deposition from the oceans to the land which resulted in the formation of vast coal swamps at that time. Low CS ratios, compared to today, during the early Paleozoic can be explained in terms of a greater abundance of euxinic basins combined with deposition of a more reactive type of organic matter in the remaining oxygenated portions of the ocean. The latter could have been due to lower oceanic oxygen levels and/or a lack of transportation of refractory terrestrial organic matter to the marine environment due to the absence of vascular land plants at that time.},

When mine wastes or pyritic shales are exposed to the atmosphere and meteoric water, however, the weathering of pyrite takes place at such a rate that it can cause pollution and geotechnical problems within a few years. Recent work on pyrite oxidation has been aimed at determining which chemical properties of the geological environment affect the rate of pyrite oxidation most and to what extent. Some investigators have leached samples of ground pyrite in the laboratory under a range of experimental conditions. They observed that the rate of pyrite oxidation depends on the surface area of the sample, on the initial concentration of oxidising agent and only slightly on the initial pH of the leaching medium. Results were expressed as a rate law which relates these experimental factors to the rate of pyrite oxidation. There is some disagreement between authors about the rate laws obtained. This may be due to changes in the properties of the pyrite surface during the experiments or to unforeseen reactions that are part of the chemical pathway for pyrite oxidation. Mechanisms have been proposed for pyrite oxidation according to theoretical considerations about chemical reactions between solute and solid, magnetic properties of substances and molecular orbital theory.},

All samples were selected to minimize 1.(1) loss of C and/or S due to weathering at the outcrop (by emphasizing the use of drill core material)2.(2) analytical errors and non-diagenetic effects (by avoiding sediments low in C or S content such as sandstones)3.(3) Fe limitation of pyrite formation (by avoiding limestones, cherts, and euxinic shales)4.(4) metamorphic loss of C, relative to S (by avoiding rocks obviously subjected to, even low-grade, metamorphism). Our results indicate that (1) there is generally a good positive linear correlation between organic C and pyrite S for normal marine shales of all ages and (2) the mean CS ratio for normal marine shales has varied over time. Devonian to Tertiary shales exhibit mean CS weight ratios (1.8 ± 0.5) somewhat lower than Quaternary sediments (meanCS = 2.8). This we believe is due to preferential C loss (relative to S) during biogenic methanogenesis plus diagenetic heating. Distinctly lower mean C/S values for the Cambrian and Ordovician (0.5 ± 0.1) cannot be explained solely in terms of diagenetic C loss and, instead, must represent low original ratios. The low original ratios, we suggest, were due mainly to the absence of bacterially refractory organic matter added to the marine environment by rivers at that time, because the major source of such material, vascular land plants, had not yet evolved. This, along with a possibly lower degree of bioturbation, contributed to enhanced pyrite formation and preservation and, thus, lower early Paleozoic CS ratios.},

	abstract = {Analyses of sulphur compounds in basin sediments off southern California indicate that elemental sulphur, free sulphide, hydrotroilite, organic sulphur, sulphate and pyrite are present in quantities that vary with environment and depth in the sediments. Pyrite is generally the most abundant form, occurring in oxidizing as well as in reducing sediments and often constituting 90 per cent of total sulphur. A material balance indicates that the total sulphur content is far in excess of the sulphate-sulphur initially trapped in the interstitial water. This evidence, together with failure to detect significant alternate sources, suggests that sulphate-sulphur is extracted from the overlying sea water at the sediment-water interface. Isotope measurements confirm many of the conclusions suggested by the quantitative chemical analyses. They show that biological sulphate reduction is the single most important process in the sulphur cycle. The sulphide released is converted to hydrotroilite and then to pyrite. Elemental and organic sulphur appear to be continually forming and reacting in the sediment column. The organic sulphur released from decaying organic matter apparently plays only a small role in the sulphur economy. Enrichment in S32 ranging from 9 to 62‰ was measured in pyrite fragments, a spread similar to that previously observed in ancient sediments. Data from field and laboratory experiments were combined to determine rate of sulphate reduction, number of sulphate reducing bacteria and the amount of organic matter decomposed during sulphate reduction in the sediment, as well as rate of renewal of water in the basins. The results suggest that the methods used may have many applications for elucidating in situ rate processes.},

The sulphur fractions are recovered as either Ag2S or BaSO4 precipitates and can further be used for isotope analysis. Overlaps between sulphur species are common during speciation, and must be minimized. Some of these overlaps are caused by poor sampling and storage, inappropriate conditions during the distillation, or natural variations in the sample (e.g. Fe3+ interference and grain size). The procedural impact was determined by conducting tests on both artificial and natural samples containing one or several sulphur species.

This complex stratigraphic record, however, is dominated by deposits from epeiric seas that are susceptible to local physical and chemical processes decoupled from the open ocean. This study contributes a unique deep water basinal perspective to the Late Ordovician (Hirnantian) glacial record and the perturbations in seawater chemistry that may have contributed to the Hirnantian mass extinction event. We analyze recently drilled cores and outcrop samples from the upper Vinini Formation in central Nevada and report combined trace- and major element geochemistry, Fe speciation ( Fe Py / Fe HR and Fe HR / Fe T ), and stable isotope chemostratigraphy (δ13COrg and δ34SPy). Measurements of paired samples from outcrop and core reveal that reactive Fe is preserved mainly as pyrite in core samples, while outcrop samples have been significantly altered as pyrite has been oxidized and remobilized by modern weathering processes. Fe speciation in the more pristine core samples indicates persistent deep water anoxia, at least locally through the Late Ordovician, in contrast to the prevailing interpretation of increased Hirnantian water column oxygenation in shallower environments. Deep water redox conditions were likely decoupled from shallower environments by a basinal shift in organic matter export driven by decreasing rates of organic matter degradation and decreasing shelf areas. The variable magnitude in the record of the Hirnantian carbon isotope excursion may be explained by this increased storage of isotopically light carbon in the deep ocean which, in combination with increased glacio-eustatic restriction, would strengthen lateral- and vertical gradients in seawater chemistry. We adopt multivariate statistical methods to deconstruct the spatial and temporal re-organization of seawater chemistry during the Hirnantian glaciation and attempt to isolate the latent magnitude and global perturbation in the carbon cycle. We speculate, using a two component mixing model and residual estimates from principal component analysis, that the secular open ocean Hirnantian C isotope excursion possibly amounts to only ∼ +1.5‰. Such an increase could be mechanistically driven by the combination of sea-level fall, persistent deep water anoxia, and cooler glacial temperatures that increased the organic carbon burial efficiency in the deeper basins.},

Such limited variability occurs in marine environments with a high ratio of calcium to carbonate alkalinity.

	abstract = {Authigenic carbonates in marine sediments frequently have carbon isotope ratios that reflect local organic carbon processing rather than the δ C 13 of the global DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) reservoir, but their contributions to ancient sedimentary sections are difficult to assess. In this study of authigenic dolomite from the Miocene-age Monterey Formation of offshore California, Mg and Ca isotopes are shown to vary with stratigraphic depth as a result of early diagenetic processes. The dolomite is a pre-compaction authigenic phase that occurs as beds and nodules with δ C 13 ranging from −16 to + 9 ‰ . Light δ C 13 values were likely acquired from the sedimentary zone of microbial sulfate reduction, while heavy δ C 13 values were acquired from the zone of methanogenesis. Mg and Ca isotopes are roughly anti-correlated, with intervals of negative δ C 13 associated with low δ Mg 26 and higher δ Ca 44 / 40 values. The variability is observed over a wide range of length-scales, from 10 − 2   meters within individual authigenic beds/nodules, to 10 2   meters over the entire stratigraphic column, and can be understood as the consequence of dolomite precipitation in pore fluids where Mg supply is limited by diffusive transport. The relationship of δ Mg 26 and δ Ca 44 / 40 to the more common stable isotope measurements of δ C 13 and δ O 18 represents a new, diagenetically robust, geochemical fingerprint for identifying synsedimentary authigenic carbonates in the geological record.},

	abstract = {A theoretical model has been constructed for calculating the concentrations of dissolved calcium, magnesium and sulfate in seawater over the past 550 million years (Phanerozoic time). It is demonstrated that the weathering of Ca carbonates and silicates by carbonic acid can be generally ignored in the modeling. A previous model of the carbon cycle is used to guide input to the oceans of Mg from carbonate and silicate weathering by H2CO3. Similarly a previous model of the sulfur cycle is used to guide input fluxes to the ocean by calcium sulfate weathering and the weathering of Ca and Mg carbonates and silicates by sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is derived from the oxidation of pyrite during weathering plus the oxidation of sulfur gases derived from the metamorphic/volcanic decomposition of pyrite and CaSO4. Calcium is removed from seawater as sedimentary carbonates and sulfates, SO4 is removed as sedimentary pyrite and CaSO4, and Mg is removed by exchange for Ca via basalt-seawater reaction and/or dolomitization (plus minor burial in sediments with pyrite as anoxic dolomite).
By adjusting starting conditions modeling results can be found that agree well with results of studies of salt fluid inclusions for variations of Ca and SO4. This is especially true of the timing when Ca was more abundant in seawater than SO4 and vice versa. General agreement was also found with fluid inclusion results for changes in the Mg/Ca ratio thereby distinguishing “calcite seas” from “aragonite seas”. Because of this overall agreement the modeling offers a new perspective on why oceanic Ca, Mg and SO4 have varied over Phanerozoic time.},

	abstract = {The major-ion (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, SO 4 2 - , and Cl−) chemistry of Cretaceous seawater was determined from analyses of seawater-derived brines preserved as fluid inclusions in marine halites. Fluid inclusions in primary halite from three evaporite deposits were analyzed by the environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) technique: the Early Cretaceous (Aptian, 121.0–112.2 Ma) of the Sergipe basin, Brazil and the Congo basin, Republic of the Congo, and the Early to Late Cretaceous (Albian to Cenomanian, 112.2–93.5 Ma) of the Khorat Plateau, Laos, and Thailand. The fluid inclusions in halite indicate that Cretaceous seawater was enriched several fold in Ca2+, depleted in SO 4 2 - , Na+, and Mg2+, and had lower Na+/Cl−, Mg2+/Ca2+, and Mg2+/K+ ratios compared to modern seawater. Elevated Ca2+ concentrations, with Ca2+ \&gt; SO 4 2 - at the point of gypsum saturation, allowed Cretaceous seawater to evolve into Mg2+–Ca2+–Na+–K+–Cl− brines lacking measurable SO 4 2 - .The major-ion composition of Cretaceous seawater was modeled from fluid inclusion chemistries for the Aptian and the Albian-Cenomanian. Aptian seawater was extreme in its Ca2+ enrichment, more than three times higher than present day seawater, with a Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio of 1.1–1.3. Younger, Albian-Cenomanian seawater had lower Ca2+ concentrations, and a higher Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio of 1.2–1.7. Cretaceous (Aptian) seawater has the lowest Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios so far documented in Phanerozoic seawater from fluid inclusions in halite, and within the range chemically favorable for precipitation of low-Mg calcite ooids and cements. Results from halite fluid inclusions, together with Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios measured from echinoderm and rudist calcite, all indicate that Early Cretaceous seawater (Hauterivian, Barremian, Aptian, and Albian) had lower Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios than Late Cretaceous seawater (Coniacian, Santonian, and Campanian). Low Aptian-Albian Mg2+/Ca2+ seawater ratios coincide with negative excursions of 87Sr/86Sr ratios and δ34SSO4, and peak Cretaceous ocean crust production rates, all of which suggests a link between seawater chemistry and midocean ridge hydrothermal brine flux.},

A comparison between seawater sulfate and marine carbonate carbon isotope records reveals no clear systematic coupling between the sulfur and carbon cycles over one to several millions of years, indicating that changes in the burial rate of pyrite sulfur and organic carbon did not singularly control the atmospheric oxygen content over short time intervals in the Cenozoic.

Associated fossil caliche, the size distribution of the burrows, and their W-shaped backfills are evidence that the burrows may have been excavated by bilaterally symmetrical organisms that grew in well-defined growth increments and were able to withstand desiccation. Among well-known soil organisms, millipedes are burrowing animals that satisfy these requirements, but have a fossil record not quite this old. This trace fossil evidence for animals on land, together with recent palynological evidence for land plants of a bryophytic grade of evolution during Late Ordovician time, are indications of terrestrial ecosystems of slightly greater antiquity and complexity than hitherto suspected.},

As a result, modern organic-rich freshwater sediments exhibit a much higher organic carbon-to-pyrite sulfur ratio (C/S) than marine sediments with similar organic contents. On this basis, C/S ratios can be used to distinguish ancient marine from freshwater (or slightly brackish) sedimentary rocks. This is demonstrated here for several Carboniferous shales and siltstones. The C/S technique cannot distinguish brackish-water sediments deposited under salinities greater than half that of seawater from marine sediments, as demonstrated by analyses of modern Chesapeake Bay sediments. Also, the method is not applicable to nearly pure limestones or to rocks low in organic matter (less than about 1\% organic carbon). Saline (high sulfate) phases of ancient lakes can be distinguished from nonsaline phases using the C/S method.},

	abstract = {The burial of organic carbon in sedimentary systems has been a fundamental part of the carbon cycle throughout the geological record, and was instrumental in major oxygenations of the atmosphere in the early Palaeoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic. While much focus has been placed on the burial of carbon in Precambrian marine carbonate and organic carbon-rich rocks deposited around the time of these major oxygenations, such deposits yield little information on the evolution of the atmosphere in the significant time between. There is, however, growing evidence from terrestrially deposited sediments to suggest the surface environment may have been at least intermittently well-oxygenated from the late Mesoproterozoic. Hence Proterozoic sediments deposited in terrestrial near-surface environments are useful targets for the study of atmospheric evolution during a time which is hitherto poorly understood.

Thus far, little attention has been paid to the contribution of large lakes and intercontinental basins to the global burial of organic carbon, and thus the progressive oxygenation of the atmosphere, especially given that the highest rates of organic carbon burial in modern aquatic environments occur in lacustrine settings, in stark contrast to the low rates observed in the contemporary marine realm. Here, we report high burial rates of organic carbon in large lacustrine systems of late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic age, which are comparable with modern lacustrine systems, and significantly higher than modern and ancient marine deposits. These data emphasise the significance of lakes as a global repository for organic carbon, and imply Proterozoic lakes were at least as efficient, and perhaps as important, as modern lakes in the global burial of organic carbon. Such findings suggest large Proterozoic lakes and epicontinental basins played a crucial role in the progressive oxygenation of the atmosphere before the major Neoproterozoic oxygenation.},

	abstract = {Geochemical data from ancient sedimentary successions provide evidence for the progressive evolution of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. Key stages in increasing oxygenation are postulated for the Palaeoproterozoic era ({\textasciitilde}2.3 billion years ago, Gyr ago) and the late Proterozoic eon (about 0.8 Gyr ago), with the latter implicated in the subsequent metazoan evolutionary expansion. In support of this rise in oxygen concentrations, a large database shows a marked change in the bacterially mediated fractionation of seawater sulphate to sulphide of Δ34S {\textless} 25‰ before 1 Gyr to ≥50‰ after 0.64 Gyr. This change in Δ34S has been interpreted to represent the evolution from single-step bacterial sulphate reduction to a combination of bacterial sulphate reduction and sulphide oxidation, largely bacterially mediated. This evolution is seen as marking the rise in atmospheric oxygen concentrations and the evolution of non-photosynthetic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria. Here we report Δ34S values exceeding 50‰ from a terrestrial Mesoproterozoic (1.18 Gyr old) succession in Scotland, a time period that is at present poorly characterized. This level of fractionation implies disproportionation in the sulphur cycle, probably involving sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, that is not evident from Δ34S data in the marine record. Disproportionation in both red beds and lacustrine black shales at our study site suggests that the Mesoproterozoic terrestrial environment was sufficiently oxygenated to support a biota that was adapted to an oxygen-rich atmosphere, but had also penetrated into subsurface sediment.},

Previous workers have inferred that each was formed in a rift basin and that each is internally conformable. New fieldwork and detrital zircon age data indicate that this model is incorrect. Our main findings are as follows: (1) the facies characteristics and detrital zircon data for the Sleat Group indicate that it is genetically unrelated to the Torridon Group; (2) the Sleat and Stoer Groups contain features suggestive of deposition in extension-related basins that predate the c. 1.0 Ga Grenville Orogeny; (3) the base of the Applecross–Aultbea succession of the Torridon Group is an unconformity; (4) the Applecross–Aultbea succession is most objectively interpreted as a non-marine molasse. The significance of these data is that they can be used as a constraint to test and define tectonic models for the deposition of the Torridonian succession and geological evolution of the Scottish Highlands. The view that the Torridonian rocks record deposition in a suite of long-lived rifts whereas the rest of the consanguineous Laurentian margin experienced collisional and orogenic episodes becomes equivocal and in need of reassessment, if not outright abandonment.},

However, oxygen levels in the Proterozoic were low enough to allow the early burial of biological material into low redox potential environments where permineralization and the authigenic replacement of organic material, including micro-organisms, occurred by a range of minerals. Consequently, microbial sulphate reduction caused the widespread degradation of organic matter and, where iron was available, the precipitation of pyrite. By contrast, where sulphate levels were low, early preservation by other minerals (e.g. phosphate or silica) could be excellent. We show, using two Proterozoic lake sequences with low and high sulphate chemistries, but with otherwise similar characteristics, that microbial sulphate reduction caused a profound loss of morphological detail and diversity within preserved microfossils. The results could imply that there is a significant bias in the Proterozoic fossil record towards low sulphate environments, which were in reality relatively scarce.

Organic-walled microfossils were first described from the non-marine Torridonian (1.2–1.0 Gyr ago) sequence of northwest Scotland in 1907. Subsequent studies found few distinctive taxa—a century later, the Torridonian microflora is still being characterized as primarily nondescript “leiospheres”. We have comprehensively sampled grey shales and phosphatic nodules throughout the Torridonian sequence. Here we report the recovery of large populations of diverse organic-walled microfossils extracted by acid maceration, complemented by studies using thin sections of phosphatic nodules that yield exceptionally detailed three-dimensional preservation. These assemblages contain multicellular structures, complex-walled cysts, asymmetric organic structures, and dorsiventral, compressed organic thalli, some approaching one millimetre in diameter. They offer direct evidence of eukaryotes living in freshwater aquatic and subaerially exposed habitats during the Proterozoic era. The apparent dominance of eukaryotes in non-marine settings by 1 Gyr ago indicates that eukaryotic evolution on land may have commenced far earlier than previously thought.},

Clay-mineral geothermometry has been applied mainly to diagenetic, hydrothermal, and contact- and burial-metamorphic settings to better understand the thermal histories of migrating fluids, hydrocarbon source beds, and ore and mineral formation. Quantitatively, the most important diagenetic clay mineral reaction in sedimentary rocks is the progressive transformation of smectite to illite via mixed-layer illite/smectite (I/S). Changes in the ordering of I/S are particularly useful in the exploration for hydrocarbons because of the common coincidence between the temperatures for the conversion from random-to-ordered I/S and those for the onset of peak, or main phase, oil generation. Using three common applications, the I/S geothermometer is compared to other mineral geothermometers, organic maturation indices, and grades of indigenous hydrocarbons. -from Author},

Major mineralogic changes with depth take place over the interval 2,000 to 3,700 m, after which no significant changes are detectable. The most abundant mineral, illite/smectite, undergoes a conversion from less than 20 percent to about 80 percent illite layers over this interval, after which the proportion of illite layers remains constant. Over the same interval, calcite decreases from about 20 percent of the rock to almost zero, disappearing from progressively larger size fractions with increasing depth; potassium feldspar (but not albite) decreases to zero; and chlorite appears to increase in amount. Variations in the bulk chemical composition of the shale with depth show only minor changes, except for a marked decrease in CaO concomitant with the decrease in calcite. By contrast, the {\textless}0.1-µm fraction (virtually pure illite/smectite) shows a large increase in K2O and Al2O3 and a decrease in SiO2 The atomic proportions closely approximate the reaction smectite + Al+3 + K+ = illite + Si+4. The potassium and aluminum appear to be derived from the decomposition of potassium feldspar (and mica?), and the excess silicon probably forms quartz. We interpret all the major mineralogical and chemical changes as the response of the shale to burial metamorphism and conclude that the shale acted as a closed system for all components except H2O, CaO, Na2O, and CO2. Compositional changes in the shale as a function of metamorphic grade closely parallel compositional changes in shale as a function of geologic age.},

This represents a significant improvement compared to commonly used biomarker maturity tools (sterane and hopane isomerisation) with their maturity maximum of approximately VR/E = 0.7\% (early part of oil window). These new parameters are: (1) the absolute concentrations of steranes and hopanes, decreasing gradually with increasing maturity; (2) the ratio of tricyclic terpanes/(tricyclic terpanes + hopanes) increasing with maturity; (3) the ratio of diasteranes/14β(H), 17β(H)-steranes depending both on maturity and on source rock lithology, and (4) the ratio of Ts/Tm (22, 29, 30-trisnorneohopane/22, 29, 30-trisnorhopane) increasing rapidly at very high maturities. During artificial maturation experiments the biomarker maturities described in the natural samples were also known to be time/temperature-dependent up to rather severe laboratory heating conditions. This corresponds with the working range up to high maturity levels as observed in the natural samples.},

	abstract = {This chapter explains how biomarker analyses are used to assess thermal maturity. The parameters are arranged by groups of related compounds in the order (1) terpanes, (2) polycadinenes and related products, (3) steranes, (4) aromatic steroids, (5) aromatic hopanoids, and (6) porphyrins. Critical information on specificity and the means for measurement are highlighted before the discussion of each parameter.Thermal maturity describes the extent of heat-driven reactions that convert sedimentary organic matter into petroleum. For example, kerogen in fine-grained source rocks can be converted thermally to oil and gas, which migrate to coarser-grained reservoir rocks (Figure 1.2). Early diagenetic processes convert bacterial and plant debris in sediments to kerogen (insoluble, particulate organic matter) and bitumen (extractable organic matter). Thermal processes generally associated with burial then convert part of this organic matter to petroleum and, ultimately, to gas and graphite. Petroleum is a complex mixture of metastable products that evolve toward greater thermodynamic stability during maturation.Note: It is thought that both kerogen and oil are unstable during catagenesis and progressively decompose to pyrobitumen and gases (e.g. Hunt, 1996; Tissot and Welte, 1984). Mango (1991) proposed that hydrocarbons in oil are much more thermally stable than their kerogenous precursors. He believes that oil and gas originate by direct thermal decomposition of kerogen but that hydrocarbons in oils do not thermally decompose to gas in the Earth. This scenario does not exclude some oxidative decomposition of hydrocarbons during thermochemical sulfate reduction (e.g. Orr, 1974; Krouse et al., 1989).},

A uniform aromatic distribution pattern with a marked predominance of di- and tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was observed throughout a depth interval of 3000 meters comprising Cretaceous and Jurassic sediments. The very high relative abundance of sulfur aromatics at two narrow intervals in the Triassic and Mississippian is attributed to a major change in facies. Gradual changes with increasing depth have been observed for a series of compound ratios, which had been calculated from the isomers of methyl- and dimethylphenanthrene, and their parent compounds. These changes reflect the increasing thermal maturation of the sedimentary organic matter. A Methylphenanthrene Index (MPI) has been introduced, which exhibited a very good correlation with vitrinite reflectance data. The MPI is the first maturity parameter which is based on a series of aromatic hydrocarbons. This hydrocarbon internal maturity parameter permits the recognition and definition of maturity levels in extracts which can be compared to the maturity (e.g. vitrinite reflectance) of source rocks.},

	abstract = {Quantitative spectrophotometric measurements of cathodoluminescence (CL) intensities of calcite cements from the Mississippian Lake Valley Formation are compared with Mn and Fe electron microprobe analyses of the same calcites. CL intensities of these calcites show excellent positive correlation with Mn concentrations at approximately constant Fe/Mn ratio and within narrow ranges of Fe contents (r = 0.76 to 0.97). Our data suggest that Fe/Mn ratios may control the maximum CL intensity of calcite. Below this maximum, at constant Fe/Mn ratios, CL intensity can vary significantly and is controlled mainly by absolute concentrations of Mn and Fe. CL intensities are therefore a function both of absolute concentrations of Mn and Fe and of Fe/Mn ratios. The data further suggest that CL intensities in calcites with low Fe concentrations ({\textless} 1,000 ppm) are more sensitive to Mn activation than to Fe quenching. CL spectra on the calcites show no evidence of rare earth element activators. Visual estimates of CL intensities of these calcite cements compare moderately well with intensities measured with the spectrophotometer. Spectrophotometrically measured CL intensities of calcites in any single visually estimated category (bright, moderate, dull, non-luminescent) overlap with those from adjacent categories. Thus spectrophotometric measurements are distinctly superior to the visual estimates. Our data indicate that calcites with more than about 100 ppm Mn will luminesce even in the presence of moderate amounts of Fe. In the absence of detectable Fe, calcites with about 150 to 650 ppm Mn have moderate CL, and those with Mn contents greater than about 700 ppm have bright CL. In the presence of detectable Fe, the amount of Mn required to impart moderate or bright CL increases with Fe content. Furthermore, Fe does not extinguish Mn-activated CL up to about 10,000 ppm Fe, the maximum of our data. These results are in general agreement with the electron microprobe study of Grover and Read (1983), in partial agreement with the data of Frank et al. (1982), and in poor agreement with the data of Fairchild (1983). Considering the poor precision of the electron probe at low element concentrations ({\textless} 100 ppm), our data are reasonably consistent with the published ion microprobe and atomic absorption data (Mason 1987; ten Have and Heijnen 1985; Richter and Zinkernagel 1981) which imply that Mn concentrations in the 30 to 50 ppm range are sufficient to activate cathodoluminescence in calcites.},

	abstract = {A suite of divalent metal (Ca, Cd, Ba) carbonates was synthesized over the temperature range 10–40°C by the classical method of slowly bubbling N2 through a bicarbonate solution. It was discovered that carbonates could be precipitated reproducibly in or out of isotopic equilibrium with the environmental solution by varying the concentrations of bicarbonate and cation. Precipitation rate had little or no influence on the isotopic composition of the product. Relatively high initial concentrations of up to 25 mM in both bicarbonate and cation were prepared by adding solid metal chlorides to solutions of NaHC03. On the basis of results of equilibrium experiments and a new determination of the acid fractionation factor, a new expression is proposed for the oxygen isotope fractionation between calcite and water at low temperatures: 10001nα(Calcite-H2O) = 18.03(103T−1) − 32.42 where α is the fractionation factor, and T is in kelvins. Combining new data for low-temperature precipitations and the high-temperature equilibrium fractionations published by O'Neil et al. (1969) results in a revised expression for the oxygen isotope fractionation between octavite (CdCO3) and water from 0° to 500°C: 10001nα(CdC0P3H2O) = 2.76(106T−2) − 3.96 The ability to produce nonequilibrium carbonates allowed assessment to be made, for the first time, of the temperature dependence of nonequilibrium stable isotope fractionations in mineral systems. The temperature coefficients of a(carbonate-water) for nonequilibrium divalent metal carbonates are greater than those for equilibrium carbonates, a finding that may bear on the interpretation of analyses of biogenic carbonates forming out of isotopic equilibrium in nature. New determinations of acid fractionation factors (10001nα) at 25°C for calcite (10.44 − 0.10), aragonite (11.01 ± 0.01), and witherite (10.57 − 0.16) are mildly to strongly different from those published by Sharma and Clayton (1965) and point to a control on this fractionation by some physical property of the mineral. Reproducible values for octavite (CdC03) varied from 11.18 to 13.60 depending on the conditions of preparation of the carbonate. These new values need to be considered in determinations of absolute 18801660 ratios of international reference standards and in relating analyses of carbonates to those of waters, silicates, and oxides.},

	abstract = {The possibility of dating minerals by the accumulation of 4He from U and Th decay has been recognized for many years (e.g., Strutt 1905), but in the century since the idea was first conceived, the method has rarely been applied successfully. After several investigations of (U-Th)/He dating of various minerals (e.g., Damon and Kulp 1957; Fanale and Kulp 1962; Damon and Green 1963; Turekian et al. 1970; Bender 1973; Leventhal 1975; Ferreira et al. 1975) the technique was essentially abandoned as yielding unreliable and usually low ages, presumably as a result of diffusive He loss possibly associated with radiation damage. In 1987, Zeitler and coworkers rekindled interest in the method by proposing that in the case of apatite, He ages might be meaningfully interpreted as ages of cooling through very low temperatures. Laboratory diffusion data presented by these authors indicated a closure temperature of about 100°C, a value supported by more recent studies (Lippolt et al. 1994; Wolf et al. 1996b; Warnock et al. 1997). Consistent with this interpretation Wolf et al. (1996a) found that apatite He ages increase systematically with sample elevation in a mountain range, as expected for exhumation-induced cooling through a low closure temperature. Based on the strength of these results and additional laboratory (Farley 2000) and natural (Warnock et al. 1997; House et al. 1999; Stockli et al. 2000) constraints on He diffusivity, recent attention has focused on applications of apatite He thermochronometry. There is also renewed interest in He dating of other U- and Th-bearing minerals both for dating mineral formation and for thermochronometry. For example, Lippolt and coworkers have undertaken detailed studies of He diffusion and dating of various phases, most notably hematite formed in hydrothermal systems (Lippolt and Weigel 1988; Wernicke …},

The study concentrates on dicyclic and tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons most of which have been identified by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The distribution patterns of the methylhomologs of naphthalene and phenanthrene are strongly controlled by rank. A sudden increase of individual isomer ratios at 0.9\% Rm coincides with an abrupt shift of the sporinite fluorescence colour from yellow towards red. A recently developed aromatics-derived maturity parameter, the Methylphenanthrene Index (MPI), correlated well with the vitrinite reflectance data over the whole rank range. Deviations have been attributed to variations of maceral composition or migration phenomena. The influence of artificial thermal alteration (350 and 400dgC) on the aromatic distribution pattern of coal is described.},

	abstract = {Vitrinite reflectance studies in non-coal-bearing rocks have been conducted over the past several years; the techniques for extraction, analysis, and interpretation of small vitrinite particles vary slightly from standard coal petrographic procedures.
Two areas in California afford a comparison of thermal history utilizing authigenic minerals and vitrinite reflectance: the Great Valley sequence of late Mesozoic age near Cache Creek west of the Sacramento Valley, and Miocene to Eocene sediments in the Tejon area of the San Joaquin Valley. In the Tejon area, laumontite is a postcompaction authigenic mineral and first occurs at 9,500 ft and is abundant below 10,500 ft. Vitrinite reflectance studies of Tejon area wells demonstrate an equivalent coal rank of high-volatile C bituminous to subbituminous A at 10,500 ft. At this depth, the temperature is 218°F (104°C), and the hydrostatic pressure is 4,600 psi (317 bars). Electrical log temperatures, as corrected by comparison with accurate subsurface temperature profiles, were used to reconstruct paleothermal conditions.
At Cache Creek, laumontite is found as an alteration product in sandstones formerly buried at depths greater than 32,500 ft; the calculated paleopressure at this level is 27,000 psi (1,860 bars). Vitrinite reflectance measurements within the laumontite-bearing interval indicate a thermal history equivalent to high-volatile B bituminous coal. Based on the temperature-reflectance relation at Tejon, the temperature at the top of the laumontite zone at Cache Creek is estimated to be 265°F (130°C), and the paleogeothermal gradient in the Great Valley sequence is around 0.62°F per 100 ft (1.1°C per 100 m). Because the formation of zeolites is governed by a complex interaction of physical and chemical factors, we judge that vitrinite reflectance, which is largely temperature dependent, is the more promising tool for the measurement of thermal history.},

We show applicability and predictive capabilities of this methodology in evaluating H:C ratios between 0.01 and 0.65 in Archean and type III kerogens. We demonstrate its application to chemical microRaman mapping by statistical analysis of a 750Ma microfossil and its encompassing sediments. Raman-derived H:C data can also be used to estimate the degree to which kerogen C-isotopic data has been shifted from its original values due to the effects of metamorphism. The new methodology directly and non-invasively affords spatially resolved assessments of organic matter preservation and microscale chemical diversity within any geologically preserved terrestrial or extraterrestrial sample, including in the use of organic matter in technological applications.},

	abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is based on the preference of 13C and 18O to form bonds with each other. At elevated temperatures such bond ordering is susceptible to resetting by diffusion of C and O through the solid mineral lattice. This type of bond reordering has the potential to obscure primary paleoclimate information, but could also provide a basis for reconstructing shallow crustal temperatures and cooling rates. We determined Arrhenius parameters for solid-state reordering of C–O bonds in two different calcites through a series of laboratory heating experiments. We find that the calcites have different susceptibilities to solid-state reordering. Reaction progress follows a first order rate law in both calcites, but only after an initial period of non-first order reaction that we suggest relates to annealing of nonequilibrium defects when the calcites are first heated to experimental temperature. We show that the apparent equilibrium temperature equations (or “closure temperature” equations) for carbonate clumped isotope reordering are analogous Dodson’s equations for first order loss of daughter isotopes. For each calcite, the sensitivity of apparent equilibrium temperature to cooling rate is sufficiently high for inference of cooling rates within a factor of ∼5 or better for cooling rates ranging from tens of degrees per day to a few degrees per million years. However, because the calcites have different susceptibilities to reordering, each calcite defines its own cooling rate–apparent equilibrium temperature relationship.

The cooling rates of Carrara marble inferred from carbonate clumped isotope geospeedometry are 10−6–10−3 degrees per annum and are in broad agreement with rates inferred from thermochronometric methods. Cooling rates for 13C-depleted calcites from the late Neoproterozoic Doushantou cap carbonates in south China are on the order of 102–104 degrees per annum, consistent with rapid cooling following formation of these calcites by a short-lived hydrothermal event (Bristow et al., 2011, Nature v. 474, p. 68–71). Most of the uncertainty in these estimates relates to uncertainty in Arrhenius parameters for different calcites. Thus, while the carbonate clumped isotope geospeedometer shows promise for recording cooling rates in settings and lithologies where other geospeedometers may not be applicable, the uncertainty in cooling rate will be large without independent knowledge of the reordering kinetics of each study material. Thus the full potential of the method will only be realized if reordering kinetics can be accurately determined for each study material, or predicted on the basis of mineral composition, texture, or other observable parameters.},

The correlation obtained was slightly different from that found previously and has resulted in an extension of the relationship to lower maturation levels (vitrinite reflectance = 0.5\% Ro). In this sample set the Methylphenanthrene Distribution Factor (Kvaldheim et al., Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta51, 1883–1888, 1987) showed a poorer correlation to vitrinite reflectance than MPI-1. Hydrogen-rich organic matter from an immature marine sequence gave anomalously high Methylphenanthrene Indices and confirms a source control on the index at low maturation levels. The index has been used to confirm the low maturity of some Australian terrestrial oils and to determine the degree of maturation of organic matter and oils in Proterozoic sediments.},

	abstract = {Few existing studies illuminate the operation of the carbon cycle before the rise of atmospheric oxygen circa 2400 million years ago. Stable carbon isotopic measurements of shallow stromatolitic carbonates (∼0‰ VPDB) and basinal carbonate minerals (−6‰) in iron formation have been used to infer a strong isotopic depth gradient in Archean ocean basins. From new diamond drill cores obtained by the Agouron Drilling Project from the Griqualand West structural basin in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, we present δ13C data from carbonates and organic matter that offer fresh insights into the Late Archean carbon cycle. Three drill cores cover the development, progradation, and ultimate demise (by drowning) of the Campbellrand carbonate platform (ca. 2590–2500 Ma); one captures the platform top shallow marine and intertidal paleoenvironments, the other two run through slope and basinal sections deposited adjacent to the platform margin, increasing in water depth (likely to \&gt;1 km). Both shallow and deep-water carbonates precipitated on the seafloor consistently show δ13C values around −0.5‰, incompatible with a strong Late Archean isotopic depth gradient. A mathematical model suggests that these isotopic data are consistent with a reduced biological pump, increased dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater due to higher atmospheric PCO2, or both. Certain horizons do show distinct isotopic variability. Such areas are commonly shaly, and they tend to be organic and/or iron rich. Strong C-isotopic variations occur on a cm scale and most likely stem from diagenetic remineralization of organic matter. In sediment-starved areas where iron formation developed, siderite tends to be 13C-depleted, sometimes by as much as −14‰. These observations suggest a carbon cycle in which iron respiration played a conspicuous role. Carbon isotope ratios from organic matter in shales are commonly \&gt;1‰ lighter than stratigraphically contiguous carbonates, but there is no clear water depth trend in the organic carbon isotopic data. Taken as a whole, the δ13C of organic matter can be explained by several non-unique sets of processes, including different autotrophic mechanisms of carbon fixation, heterotrophic recycling (including fermentation and methanotrophy), and post-depositional diagenesis. The most striking feature is the occurrence of organic δ13C values \&lt;−40‰, a feature that appears to be commonplace in Late Archean successions. Framed in the context of carbon cycle isotopic mass balance, both organic and carbonate carbon isotopic data suggest that the proportion of carbon buried as organic matter was not radically different before the appearance of free environmental oxygen.},

	abstract = {The Kaapvaal Craton of South Africa comprises an Archaean core of ≈3.5 Ga lithospheric and crustal rocks surrounded by younger accreted terrains of ≈3.0–2.7 and ≈2.1–1.9 Ga. The craton is covered by relatively undeformed 3.0–2.4 Ga supracrustal rocks, which show the effects of thermal and hydrothermal interaction. Part of this activity is manifested by a large number of epigenetic Pb–Zn (±Ag, Au, Cu, F) deposits in the cover rocks of the Kaapvaal Craton. These include small volcanic and breccia hosted deposits in mafic and felsic volcanic rocks of the 2.7 Ga Ventersdorp Supergroup and the Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) deposits in the carbonates of the Transvaal Supergroup.

MVT mineralization at the Pering (and other Zn–Pb deposits) is hosted in fracture-generated N–S breccia bodies in the Paleoproterozoic carbonate succession of the western Kaapvaal Craton. The fluids carrying the metals were focused in vertical bodies within the fracture zones (FZ), the metals and the sulphur being carried together and precipitated in organic-rich sectors of the basin. Two small Pb–Zn deposits within mafic rocks of the Ventersdorp Supergroup, stratigraphically below the basin-hosted MVTs on the southwestern part of the Kaapvaal Craton have secondary chlorite which is extremely Rb-rich, associated with the mineralization. This chlorite and the associated altered basaltic host rocks give a Rb–Sr date of ≈1.98 Ga, and the associated galena Pb isotope data plot on the same array as those of other Pb–Zn deposits, the radiogenic intercept giving a date of ≈2.0 Ga. We interpret these data to indicate a craton-wide epigenetic fluid-infiltration event, which exploited the Maquassie Quartz Porphyry (MQP) as the aquifer and metal source.

Sr isotopic results for the ore-zone gangue minerals show highly radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios (\&gt;0.710) which support earlier models that the origin of radiogenic Sr isotopic composition in the calcite cements is the felsic tuffs (MQP) of the Ventersdorp Supergroup occurring at deeper levels within the basin. Relationships between δ18O and δ13C performed on carbonate cements within the aquifers are complex: the range in δ13C for some of the cements represents a mixture from two sources and with a progression from heavy carbon in the host to somewhat lighter carbon in the cements. Similarly, the lighter δ18O values have a narrow range indicative of rapid exchanges between hydrous fluid and rock.},

The suggestion that this results entirely from weathering and low temperature exchange with groundwater is not tenable. Metamorphism also fails to explain observed low 18O values. Two hypotheses that fit the isotopic data are: 1) precipitation of chert and carbonate from a hot Proterozoic ocean (60° C for Precambrian X), or (2) precipitation of chert and carbonate from a Proterozoic ocean depleted in 18O. Both of these hypotheses have important implications.
Close association of diamictite with the Kuruman Iron Formation (Precambrian X) suggests that hypothesis 2 is more likely. A detailed study of this diamictite and its stratigraphic relation to the iron formation, however, is required to confirm this observation. A Late Archean (Precambrian W) iron formation (Weld Range, Western Australia) is strongly depleted in 18O. If this depletion results from deposition in a brackish water environment, it implies that the hydrologic regime during the Archean/Proterozoic transition was similar to the modern hydrologic regime.},

	abstract = {Many fields of Earth sciences benefit from the knowledge of mineral formation temperatures. For example, carbonates are extensively used for reconstruction of the Earth’s past climatic variations by determining ocean, lake, and soil paleotemperatures. Furthermore, diagenetic minerals and their formation or alteration temperature may provide information about the burial history of important geological units and can have practical applications, for instance, for reconstructing the geochemical and thermal histories of hydrocarbon reservoirs.

Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is a relatively new technique that can provide the formation temperature of carbonate minerals without requiring a priori knowledge of the isotopic composition of the initial solution. It is based on the temperature-dependent abundance of the rare 13C–18O bonds in carbonate minerals, specified as a Δ47 value. The clumped isotope thermometer has been calibrated experimentally from 1 °C to 70 °C. However, higher temperatures that are relevant to geological processes have so far not been directly calibrated in the laboratory.

In order to close this calibration gap and to provide a robust basis for the application of clumped isotopes to high-temperature geological processes we precipitated CaCO3 (mainly calcite) in the laboratory between 23 and 250 °C. We used two different precipitation techniques: first, minerals were precipitated from a CaCO3 supersaturated solution at atmospheric pressure (23–91 °C), and, second, from a solution resulting from the mixing of CaCl2 and NaHCO3 in a pressurized reaction vessel at a pressure of up to 80 bar (25–250 °C).

The calibration lines of both experimental approaches overlap and agree in the slopes with theoretical estimates and with other calibration experiments in which carbonates were reacted with phosphoric acid at temperatures above 70 °C. Our study suggests a universal Δ47-T calibration (T in K, Δ47 in ‰): Δ 47 = 0.98 ( ± 0.01 ) · ( - 3.407 · 10 9 / T 4 + 2.365 · 10 7 / T 3 - 2.607 · 10 3 / T 2 - 5.880 / T ) + 0.293 ( ± 0.004 ) This new Δ47-T calibration (given in the absolute reference frame), that extends the experimentally calibrated temperature range for clumped isotopes to 250 °C, can be applied to carbonates that grew at intermediate temperatures (20–250 °C).},

	abstract = {An essential procedure to increase the analytical efficiency of Δ47 measurements requires raising the temperature of phosphoric acid digestion for carbonate materials. This temperature change introduces a fractionation offset in Δ47 that must be accounted for prior to calculation of temperatures of carbonate formation and to allow interlaboratory comparison of results. We measured the phosphoric acid fractionation factor relative to reaction at 25 °C for calcite, aragonite, and dolomite across a temperature range from 25 to 90 °C. Significantly, all three minerals behave similarly during phosphoric acid digestion, allowing for a single temperature dependent acid fractionation relationship: 1000 ln ∝ C O 2 Acid − Δ 47 = 0.022434 ± 0.001490 ∗ 10 6 T 2 − 0.2524 ± 0.0168 where α is the phosphoric acid fractionation factor, and T is in degrees Kelvin. Mineralogical or isotopic compositional effects on the fractionation factor were not observed, suggesting that this acid fractionation factor may be valid for all carbonate minerals.

We also present inorganic temperature calibrations for both calcite and aragonite at low temperatures (5–70 °C) and find them to agree with prior published data. Using the new acid fractionation factor, published Δ47–temperature calibrations are recalculated. This analysis confirms a statistically significant Δ47–temperature calibration difference between data analyzed at 25 °C versus higher temperatures. The origin of the discrepancy remains unknown, but it appears that the acid fractionation factor is not the cause.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing the thermal history of minerals and fluids in continental environments is a cornerstone of tectonics research. Paleotemperature constraints from carbonate clumped isotope thermometry have provided important tests of geodynamic, structural, topographic and basin evolution models. The thermometer is based on the 13C–18O bond ordering in carbonates (mass-47 anomaly, Δ47) and provides estimates of the carbonate formation temperature independent of the δ18O value of the water from which the carbonate grew; Δ47 is measured simultaneously with conventional measurements of carbonate δ13C and δ18O values, which together constrain the isotopic composition of the parent water. Depending on the geologic setting of carbonate growth, this information can help constrain paleoenvironmental conditions or basin temperatures and fluid sources. This review examines how clumped isotope thermometry can shed new light on problems in continental tectonics, focusing on paleoaltimetry, basin evolution and structural diagenesis applications. Paleoaltimetry is inherently difficult, and the precision in carbonate growth temperature estimates is at the limit of what is useful for quantitative paleoelevation reconstruction. Nevertheless, clumped isotope analyses have enabled workers to address previously intractable problems and in many settings offer the best chance of understanding topographic change from the geologic record. The portion of the shallow crust residing at temperatures up to ca. 200 °C is important as host to economic resources and records of tectonics and climate, and clumped isotope thermometry is one of the few proxies that can access this critical range with sensitivity to temperature alone. Only a handful of studies to date have used clumped isotopes to investigate diagenesis and other sub-surface processes using carbonate crystallization temperatures or the sensitivity of Δ47 values to a sample's thermal history. However, the thermometer is sufficiently precise to answer many important questions in this area, making the investigation of sub-surface processes an excellent target for future investigations.},

groups within solid carbonate minerals. This thermometer has now been calibrated for various synthetic and natural biogenic
and abiogenic minerals (calcite, aragonite and carbonateapatites [e.g., 1, 2]) at temperatures below {\textasciitilde} 50°C. Here we
extend the use of the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer to shallow crustal environments by determining the Δ\_(47) values
of CO\_2 extracted from natural and synthetic dolomites grown at know temperatures from 25 to 350ºC. The experimental
temperature dependance is not linear in the Δ\_(47) vs T{\textasciicircum}(-2) plot and resembles the predicted theoretical temperature dependence,
both in shape and absolute value [3]. These data for synthetic dolomites overlap the previous calibrations for inorganic
calcite and some forms of biogenic carbonates between 25 and 50˚C, and are consistent with a single trend that also intersects
data for synthetic calcite equilibrated at 1200˚C. These observations suggest that a single temperature dependant
relationship reasonably approximates the calibration for both phases. Data from a variety of slowly-cooled (i.e., over
geological timescales) natural marbles and rapid (i.e., laboratory timescales) heating experiments provide insights
into the kinetics of solid-state {\textasciicircum}(13)C-{\textasciicircum}(18)O bond reordering in carbonates and its closure temperature. More generally, our
new calibration and constraints on high-temperature kinetics have implications for the application of this technique to burial
and metamorphic processes. These issues will be illustrated through estimates of the thermal history and oxygen isotopic
compositions and abundances of pore fluids for several suites of late Neoproterozoic carbonates [e.g., 4].},

Although these methods show approximately the same relationship between temperature and α, they are offset from one another by between 0.2 and 0.4\% over the temperature range 25–90°C. There appears to be no temperature- or technique-dependent fractionation on carbon over the range of temperatures examined in this study. The difference between these two methods arises from three main processes: (1) isotopic exchange between the CO2, the phosphate polymers in the acid and water produced in the reaction; (2) dissolution of CO2 in the acid; and (3) incomplete removal of CO2 during the extraction process. Of these two methods the “acid bath” method probably provides the most accurate isotopic composition of the calcite. As a result of the fact the original fractionation factors were determined using the “sealed vessel” method, we have calculated our temperature [T (K)] - dependent fractionation factor (αT) taking into account the difference between the two methods at 25°C. For the “sealed vessel” method: (a) αT= [5.60 (± 0.33) × 102] T−2 + 1.003943 (± 0.000067). For the “common acid bath” technique: (b) αT = [5.25 (± 0.08) × 102] T −2 + 1.003970 (± 0.000034).},

Such species form the basis of carbonate clumped-isotope thermometry and undergo distinctive fractionations during a variety of natural processes, but initial reports have provided few details of their analysis. In this study, we present detailed data and arguments regarding the theoretical and practical limits of precision, methods of standardization, instrument linearity and related issues for clumped-isotope analysis by dual-inlet gas-source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). We demonstrate long-term stability and subtenth per mil precision in 47/44 ratios for counting systems consisting of a Faraday cup registered through a 1012 Ω resistor on three Thermo-Finnigan 253 IRMS systems. Based on the analyses of heated CO2 gases, which have a stochastic distribution of isotopes among possible isotopologues, we document and correct for (1) isotopic exchange among analyte CO2 molecules and (2) subtle nonlinearity in the relationship between actual and measured 47/44 ratios. External precisions of ∼0.01‰ are routinely achieved for measurements of the mass-47 anomaly (a measure mostly of the abundance anomaly of 13C-18O bonds) and follow counting statistics. The present technical limit to precision intrinsic to our methods and instrumentation is ∼5 parts per million (ppm), whereas precisions of measurements of heterogeneous natural materials are more typically ∼10 ppm (both 1 s.e.).

This proportionality can be described between 1 and 50 °C by the function: Δ47 = 0.0592 · 106 · T−2 − 0.02, where Δ47 is the enrichment, in per mil, of 13C18O16O in CO2 relative to the amount expected for a stochastic (random) distribution of isotopes among all CO2 isotopologues, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. This relationship can be used for a new kind of carbonate paleothermometry, where the temperature-dependent property of interest is the state of ordering of 13C and 18O in the carbonate lattice (i.e., bound together vs. separated into different CO32− units), and not the bulk δ18O or δ13C values. Current analytical methods limit precision of this thermometer to ca. ± 2 °C, 1σ. A key feature of this thermometer is that it is thermodynamically based, like the traditional carbonate–water paleothermometer, and so is suitable for interpolation and even modest extrapolation, yet is rigorously independent of the δ18O of water and δ13C of DIC from which carbonate grew. Thus, this technique can be applied to parts of the geological record where the stable isotope compositions of waters are unknown. Moreover, simultaneous determinations of Δ47 and δ18O for carbonates will constrain the δ18O of water from which they grew.},

Temperatures within the aureole of contact metamorphism likely did not significantly exceed 450°C as suggested by the presence of early diagenetic carbonates, greenalite, and stilpnomelane (formed prior to intrusion) in chert-rich facies as close as 4 m from the sill. In sediments 32 m away from the intrusion, a temperature of ∼ 280°C is indicated by the magnitude of 18O fractionation between successive chert and siderite microbands; in unmetamorphosed equivalents similar isotopic analyses on whole-rock samples yield temperature estimates between 150 and 230°C. In comparison with samples of similar lithofacies from the underlying Campbellrand-Kuruman transition zone, carbonates from within the metamorphic aureole are depleted in 13C and 18O. The abundance and C-isotopic composition of total organic C (TOC) in whole-rock samples is lower and more enriched in 13C than those in samples outside of the zone of contact metamorphism. Within 5 m of the diabase sill the abundance of Fe increases dramatically and the oxidation state of the sediments fluctuates considerably more than in sediments outside of the metamorphic aureole. Isotopic and mineralogic systematics in the zone of contact metamorphism in the Kuruman Iron Formation are similar to those in siliceous dolomites and limestones altered by similar thermal processes. As the most distinct isotopic and elemental variations occur within 10 m of the diabase sill, it is suggested that volatilization and fluid infiltration associated with the intrusion were the main processes of alteration. Consideration of the effects of metamorphism (both contact and regional) as well as early diagenesis on the mineralogy and isotopic chemistry of BIF sediments may be a key to our understanding of primary mineralogies and oxidation state of these enigmatic deposits.},

	abstract = {Clumped isotope geochemistry is concerned with the state of ordering of rare isotopes in natural materials. That is, it examines the extent to which rare isotopes (D, 13C, 15N, 18O, etc.) bond with or near each other rather than with the sea of light isotopes in which they swim. Abundances of isotopic ‘clumps’ in natural materials are influenced by a wide variety of factors. In most cases, their concentrations approach (within ca. 1\%, relative) the amount expected for a random distribution of isotopes. Deviations from this stochastic distribution result from: enhanced thermodynamic stability of heavy-isotope ‘clumps’; slower kinetics of reactions requiring the breakage of bonds between heavy isotopes; the mass dependence of diffusive and thermo-gravitational fractionations; mixing between components that differ from one another in bulk isotopic composition; biochemical and photochemical fractionations that may reflect combinations of these simpler physical mechanisms; and, in some cases, other processes we do not yet understand. Although clumped isotope geochemistry is a young field, several seemingly promising applications have already emerged. Most importantly, it appears that proportions of 13C–18O bonds in carbonate minerals are sensitive to their growth temperatures, independent of bulk isotopic composition. Thus, ‘clumped isotope’ analysis of ancient carbonates can be used as a quantitative paleothermometer that requires no assumptions about the δ18O of waters from which carbonates grew. This approach has been used to reconstruct marine temperatures across the Phanerozoic (reaching back to the Silurian), terrestrial ground temperatures across the Cenozoic, thermal histories of aqueously altered meteorites, among other applications. Clumped isotope geochemistry is also placing new constraints on the atmospheric budget and stratospheric photochemistry of CO2, and should be capable of placing analogous new constraints on the budgets of other atmospheric gases. Finally, this field could be extended to encompass sulfates, volatile hydrocarbons, organic moieties and other materials.},

We derive a method for calculating abundances of all such species in a thermodynamically equilibrated population of isotopologues, and present results of these calculations for O2, CO, N2, NO, CO2, and N2O between 1000 and 193 to 77 K. In most cases, multiply substituted isotopologues are predicted to be enriched relative to stochastic (random) distributions by ca. 1 to 2‰ at earth-surface temperatures. This deviation, defined as Δi for isotopologue i, generally increases linearly with 1/T at temperatures ≤ 500 K. An exception is N2O, which shows complex temperature dependences and 10’s of per-mill enrichments or depletions of abundances for some isotopologues. These calculations provide a basis for discriminating between fractionations controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics and other sorts of isotopic fractionations in the budgets of atmospheric gases. Moreover, because abundances of multiply substituted isotopologues in thermodynamically equilibrated populations of molecules vary systematically with temperature, they can be used as geothermometers. Such thermometers are unusual in that they involve homogeneous rather than heterogeneous equilibria (e.g., isotopic distribution in gaseous CO2 alone, rather than difference in isotopic composition between CO2 and coexisting water). Also, multiple independent thermometers exist for all molecules having more than one multiply substituted isotopologue (e.g., thermometers based on abundances of 18O13C16O and 18O12C18O are independent); thus, temperatures estimated by this method can be tested for internal consistency.},

The estimated temperature and δ18O(H2O) are similar to those of modern diffuse flow fluids at mid-ocean ridges, the kind of fluid that has been proposed previously as the dolomitizing fluid in the Latemar buildup, based on the trace element compositions of dolomite. Calcite in limestone preserves original δ18O, but records clumped isotope temperatures, 44−76 ± 9−11 °C (±2 SD), that are higher than those at which the limestone formed. Temperature recorded by calcite, but not δ18O, was likely reset during dolomitization. Clumped isotope thermometry has great potential for application to studies of burial and diagenesis by retrieving independent estimates of temperature and δ18O(H2O) with uncertainties as low as ±5 °C (±2 standard errors, SE) and ± 0.75‰ (±2 SE), respectively, from a single stable isotope analysis of a carbonate mineral.},

	abstract = {We describe an approach to estimating the crystallization temperatures of diagenetic calcites using clumped-isotope thermometry, a paleothermometer based on the 13C–18O-bond enrichment in carbonates. Application of this thermometer to calcified gastropod shells and calcite cements in an early Eocene limestone from the Colorado Plateau reveals a record of calcite precipitation and replacement at temperatures varying from 14 to 123°C. The early Eocene host sediments were never deeply buried, but they experienced a significant thermal pulse associated with the emplacement of a late Miocene basalt flow. The combination of independent constraints on thermal history with clumped-isotope thermometry, petrographic (including cathodoluminescence) observations, and oxygen isotopic data provides an improved basis for estimation of the temperature and timing of diagenetic events and fluid sources. The petrography and calcite δ18O values, taken alone, suggest that the aragonite-to-calcite transformation of gastropod shell material occurred simultaneously with early formation of cements and lithification of the matrix in the same sample. However, addition of clumped-isotope thermometry demonstrates that this phase transformation of shell material occurred at temperatures of 94–123°C in a highly rock-buffered microenvironment (i.e., with the isotopic composition of fluid buffered by coexisting carbonate), millions of years after lithification of the matrix and formation of initial low-temperature (14–19°C) calcite cements within shell body cavities. Clumped-isotope temperatures in excess of reasonable Earth-surface conditions recorded by later-formed cements demand that cement growth occurred in association with the lava emplacement. Our results illustrate the potential for clumped-isotope thermometry to constrain conditions of diagenesis and guide interpretations that would not be possible on the basis of conventional stable-isotopic and petrographic data alone, and demonstrate how petrographic characterization of clumped-isotope thermometry samples can benefit paleoclimate studies.},

	abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry is a promising method for paleoclimate reconstructions and understanding diagenetic processes, although clumped isotope compositions (measured as Δ47 values) can be altered by recrystallization and thermal resetting. Several studies have investigated the effects of deep burial and exhumation on Δ47 values; we present Δ47 values of samples from an ∼4500-m-long drill core from Andros Island, Bahamas, which represent the spectrum from shallow to deep burial conditions. These limestones and dolomites originally formed under near-surface temperature conditions, which are reflected by ∼27 °C Δ47 temperatures in samples buried to {\textless}∼1.3 km depth. Below this depth, calculated Δ47 temperatures increase by ∼10 °C, indicating a shift from preserved near-surface temperatures to diagenetically modified values. Importantly, this shift is not accompanied by a change in δ18O and δ13C values or cathodoluminescence, and non-uniform micrometer-scale crystallization is observed in both Δ47-altered and unaltered rocks. Similar Δ47 temperatures recorded by each carbonate phase suggest that mineral-specific differences are minor. Fine-grained dolomites and calcites are viable materials for recording surface temperature conditions, and both are susceptible to alteration of their primary clumped isotope abundances during burial diagenesis. Our results demonstrate that original Δ47 values of fine-grained carbonates can be altered under mild diagenetic conditions.},

This study investigates one of the few examples of dolomitization of Lower Cretaceous shallow-water limestones from the southern Tethys carbonate platform from outcrops on the Haushi-Huqf High in central-east Oman. Mud-dominated peritidal carbonates rich in microbial mats are replaced by fine crystalline dolomite along at least 60 km in the lower 10 m of the Jurf Formation. Two, meter-thick beds in the overlying Qishn Formation are also dolomitized over lateral distances of one to two kilometers. The stratabound geometry and petrographic relations of the dolomite with all other diagenetic phases indicate that the dolomite precipitated early. The presence of only rare anhydrite relicts suggests that seawater was below gypsum saturation during most of the dolomitization, supporting the hypothesis that Cretaceous slightly evaporated water (δ18Ofluid values range from 2.8‰ to 3.5‰ SMOW) can affect pervasive dolomitization. Despite being composed of peritidal facies with features suggesting high salinity, most of the carbonate succession was not dolomitized, suggesting that the presence of microbial mats exerted a major control on the distribution of dolomite, and that salinity is only a minor control on dolomitization. Clumped-isotope results indicate that the early formed dolomite re-equilibrated with fluids at 44 ± 3°C in a shallow-burial setting. The elevated iron content (on average 6011 ppm) and 87Sr/86Sr (on average 0.70782) with respect to Cretaceous seawater suggests that the burial fluids interacted with Permian clay and feldspars of the Gharif Formation that underlies the Cretaceous carbonates. The vertical gradients of radiogenic Sr and the occurrence of small volumes of coarse crystalline dolomite in stylolites and fractures suggests that burial fluids were driven vertically and laterally by differential compaction, probably during maximum burial in the Late Cretaceous.},

When using calcite/dolomite [104] peak ratios, each 1\% of excess calcium in the dolomite lattice causes approximately a 2\% overestimate of the amount of dolomite. Use of the [113] peak ratios avoids the stoichiometry problem; however. if quartz is present, the interference between the [102] quartz peak ( d = 2.282 A) and the [113] calcite peak ( d = 2.285 A) can cause a serious underestimate of the dolomite proportion. In addition, error will occur if the crystallite size in the powdered standards used to prepare X-ray calibration curves differs significantly from the crystallite size in the sample unknowns. All these errors can be avoided or corrected; however, point count or visual estimation of stained thin sections is a simple, reliable technique and is preferable for routine analysis of visibly crystalline, lithified, sediment.},

	abstract = {The San Andreas Fault System, one of the best-studied transform plate boundaries on Earth, is well known for its complex network of locked faults that slowly deform the crust in response to large-scale plate motions. Horizontal interseismic motions of the fault system are largely predictable, but vertical motions arising from tectonic sources remain enigmatic. Here we show that when carefully treated for spatial consistency, global positioning system-derived vertical velocities expose a small-amplitude (±2 mm yr−1), but spatially considerable (200 km), coherent pattern of uplift and subsidence straddling the fault system in southern California. We employ the statistical method of model selection to isolate this vertical velocity field from non-tectonic signals that induce velocity variations in both magnitude and direction across small distances (less than tens of kilometres; ref. 9), and find remarkable agreement with the sense of vertical motions predicted by physical earthquake cycle models spanning the past few centuries. We suggest that these motions reveal the subtle, but identifiable, tectonic fingerprint of far-field flexure due to more than 300 years of fault locking and creeping depth variability. Understanding this critical component of interseismic deformation at a complex strike–slip plate boundary will better constrain regional mechanics and crustal rheology, improving the quantification of seismic hazards in southern California and beyond.},
